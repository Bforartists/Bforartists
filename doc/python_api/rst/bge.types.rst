Game Types (bge.types)
======================

.. module:: bge.types

.. class:: PyObjectPlus

   PyObjectPlus base class of most other types in the Game Engine.

   .. attribute:: invalid

      Test if the object has been freed by the game engine and is no longer valid.
       
      Normally this is not a problem but when storing game engine data in the GameLogic module, 
      KX_Scenes or other KX_GameObjects its possible to hold a reference to invalid data.
      Calling an attribute or method on an invalid object will raise a SystemError.
       
      The invalid attribute allows testing for this case without exception handling.

      :type: boolean

      A level detector will immediately generate a pulse, negative or positive
      depending on the sensor condition, as soon as the state is activated.
      A edge detector will wait for a state change before generating a pulse.
      note: mutually exclusive with :data:`tap`, enabling will disable :data:`tap`.

      :type: boolean

   .. attribute:: tap

      When enabled only sensors that are just activated will send a positive event,

.. class:: CListValue(CPropValue)

   This is a list like object used in the game engine internally that behaves similar to a python list in most ways.

   As well as the normal index lookup (``val= clist[i]``), CListValue supports string lookups (``val= scene.objects["Cube"]``)

   Other operations such as ``len(clist)``, ``list(clist)``, ``clist[0:10]`` are also supported.

   .. method:: append(val)

      Add an item to the list (like pythons append)

      :return: The key value or a default.

   .. method:: from_id(id)

      This is a funtion especially for the game engine to return a value with a spesific id.

      Since object names are not always unique, the id of an object can be used to get an object from the CValueList.

      Example:

      .. code-block:: python
        
         myObID=id(gameObject)
         ob= scene.objects.from_id(myObID)

      Where ``myObID`` is an int or long from the id function.

      This has the advantage that you can store the id in places you could not store a gameObject.

      .. warning::

         The id is derived from a memory location and will be different each time the game engine starts.

         if obj:
            # do something
            pass

      The face paremeter determines the orientation of the normal.

      * 0 => hit normal is always oriented towards the ray origin (as if you casted the ray from outside)
      * 1 => hit normal is the real face normal (only for mesh object, otherwise face has no effect)

      The ray has X-Ray capability if xray parameter is 1, otherwise the first object hit (other than self object) stops the ray.
      The prop and xray parameters interact as follow.

      * prop off, xray off: return closest hit or no hit if there is no object on the full extend of the ray.
      * prop off, xray on : idem.
      * prop on, xray off: return closest hit if it matches prop, no hit otherwise.
      * prop on, xray on : return closest hit matching prop or no hit if there is no object matching prop on the full extend of the ray.

      The :class:`KX_PolyProxy` 4th element of the return tuple when poly=1 allows to retrieve information on the polygon hit by the ray.
      If there is no hit or the hit object is not a static mesh, None is returned as 4th element.

      The ray ignores collision-free objects and faces that dont have the collision flag enabled, you can however use ghost objects.

      :arg objto: [x, y, z] or object to which the ray is casted
      :type objto: :class:`KX_GameObject` or 3-tuple
      :arg objfrom: [x, y, z] or object from which the ray is casted; None or omitted => use self object center
      :type objfrom: :class:`KX_GameObject` or 3-tuple or None

      :arg prop: property name that object must have; can be omitted or "" => detect any object
      :type prop: string

      :type face: integer
      :arg xray: X-ray option: 1=>skip objects that don't match prop; 0 or omitted => stop on first object
      :type xray: integer
      :arg poly: polygon option: 0, 1 or 2 to return a 3-, 4- or 5-tuple with information on the face hit.

         * 0 or omitted: return value is a 3-tuple (object, hitpoint, hitnormal) or (None, None, None) if no hit
         * 1: return value is a 4-tuple and the 4th element is a :class:`KX_PolyProxy` or None if no hit or the object doesn't use a mesh collision shape.
         * 2: return value is a 5-tuple and the 5th element is a 2-tuple (u, v) with the UV mapping of the hit point or None if no hit, or the object doesn't use a mesh collision shape, or doesn't have a UV mapping.

      :type poly: integer
      :return: (object, hitpoint, hitnormal) or (object, hitpoint, hitnormal, polygon) or (object, hitpoint, hitnormal, polygon, hituv).

         * object, hitpoint and hitnormal are None if no hit.
         * polygon is valid only if the object is valid and is a static object, a dynamic object using mesh collision shape or a soft body object, otherwise it is None

.. class:: KX_MeshProxy(SCA_IObject)

   A mesh object.

   You can only change the vertex properties of a mesh object, not the mesh topology.

   To use mesh objects effectively, you should know a bit about how the game engine handles them.

   #. Mesh Objects are converted from Blender at scene load.
   #. The Converter groups polygons by Material.  This means they can be sent to the renderer efficiently.  A material holds:

      #. The texture.
      #. The Blender material.
      #. The Tile properties
      #. The face properties - (From the "Texture Face" panel)
      #. Transparency & z sorting
      #. Light layer
      #. Polygon shape (triangle/quad)
      #. Game Object

   #. Verticies will be split by face if necessary.  Verticies can only be shared between faces if:

      #. They are at the same position
      #. UV coordinates are the same
      #. Their normals are the same (both polygons are "Set Smooth")
      #. They are the same colour, for example: a cube has 24 verticies: 6 faces with 4 verticies per face.

   .. method:: setCustomMaterial(material)

      Sets the material state setup object.

      Using this method, you can extend or completely replace the gameengine material
      to do your own advanced multipass effects.

      Use this method to register your material class.  Instead of the normal material, 
      your class's activate method will be called just before rendering the mesh.
      This should setup the texture, material, and any other state you would like.
      It should return True to render the mesh, or False if you are finished.  You should
      clean up any state Blender does not set before returning False.

      or the colour attribute instead.

      setRGBA() also accepts a four component list as argument col.  The list represents the colour as [r, g, b, a]
      with black = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0] and white = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

      .. code-block:: python

         v.setRGBA(0xff0000ff) # Red
         v.setRGBA(0xff00ff00) # Green on little endian, transparent purple on big endian
         v.setRGBA([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]) # Red

      :type: vector [X, Y, Z].

      .. note::
      
         You can only move a bone if it is unconnected to its parent. An action playing on the armature may change the value. An IK chain does not update this value, see joint_rotation.

   .. attribute:: joint_rotation

      Control bone rotation in term of joint angle (for robotic applications), read-write.

      When writing to this attribute, you pass a [x, y, z] vector and an appropriate set of euler angles or quaternion is calculated according to the rotation_mode.

      When you read this attribute, the current pose matrix is converted into a [x, y, z] vector representing the joint angles.

      The value and the meaning of the x, y, z depends on the ik_dof_x/ik_dof_y/ik_dof_z attributes:

      * 1DoF joint X, Y or Z: the corresponding x, y, or z value is used an a joint angle in radiant
      * 2DoF joint X+Y or Z+Y: treated as 2 successive 1DoF joints: first X or Z, then Y. The x or z value is used as a joint angle in radiant along the X or Z axis, followed by a rotation along the new Y axis of y radiants.
      * 2DoF joint X+Z: treated as a 2DoF joint with rotation axis on the X/Z plane. The x and z values are used as the coordinates of the rotation vector in the X/Z plane.
      * 3DoF joint X+Y+Z: treated as a revolute joint. The [x, y, z] vector represents the equivalent rotation vector to bring the joint from the rest pose to the new pose.

      :type: vector [x, y, z]
      
      .. note::
      
         The bone must be part of an IK chain if you want to set the ik_dof_x/ik_dof_y/ik_dof_z attributes via the UI, but this will interfere with this attribute since the IK solver will overwrite the pose. You can stay in control of the armature if you create an IK constraint but do not finalize it (e.g. don't set a target) the IK solver will not run but the IK panel will show up on the UI for each bone in the chain.

      .. note::
      
         [0, 0, 0] always corresponds to the rest pose.

      .. note::
      
         You must request the armature pose to update and wait for the next graphic frame to see the effect of setting this attribute (see :data:`BL_ArmatureObject.update`).

      .. note::
      
         You can read the result of the calculation in rotation or euler_rotation attributes after setting this attribute.
