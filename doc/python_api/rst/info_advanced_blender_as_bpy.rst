Blender as a Python Module
**************************

Blender supports being built as a Python module,
allowing ``import bpy`` to be added to any Python script, providing access to Blender's features.

.. note::

   Blender as a Python Module isn't provided on Blender's official download page.

   - A pre-compiled ``bpy`` module is
     `available via PIP <https://pypi.org/project/bpy/>`__.
   - Or you may compile this yourself using the
     `build instructions <https://wiki.blender.org/w/index.php?title=Building_Blender/Other/BlenderAsPyModule>`__.


Use Cases
=========

Python developers may wish to integrate Blender scripts which don't center around Blender.

Possible uses include:

- Visualizing data by rendering images and animations.
- Image processing using Blender's compositor.
- Video editing (using Blender's sequencer).
- 3D file conversion.
- Development, accessing ``bpy`` from Python IDE's and debugging tools for example.
- Automation.


Usage
=====

For the most part using Blender as a Python module is equivalent to running a script in background-mode
(passing the command-line arguments ``--background`` or ``-b``),
however there are some differences to be aware of.

.. Sorted alphabetically as there isn't an especially a logical order to show them.

Blender's Executable Access
   The attribute :class:`bpy.app.binary_path` defaults to an empty string.

   If you wish to point this to the location of a known executable you may set the value.

   This example searches for the binary, setting it when found:

   .. code-block:: python

      import bpy
      import shutil

      blender_bin = shutil.which("blender")
      if blender_bin:
         print("Found:", blender_bin)
         bpy.app.binary_path = blender_bin
      else:
         print("Unable to find blender!")

Blender's Internal Modules
   There are many modules included with Blender such as :mod:`gpu` and :mod:`mathuils`.
   It's important that these are imported after ``bpy`` or they will not be found.

Command Line Arguments Unsupported
   Functionality controlled by command line arguments (shown by calling ``blender --help`` aren't accessible).

   Typically this isn't such a limitation although there are some command line arguments that don't have
   equivalents in Blender's Python API (``--threads`` and ``--log`` for example).

   .. note::

      Access to these settings may be added in the future as needed.

Resource Sharing (GPU)
   It's possible other Python modules make use of the GPU in a way that prevents Blender/Cycles from accessing the GPU.

Signal Handlers
   Blender's typical signal handlers are not initialized, so there is no special handling for ``Control-C``
   to cancel a render and a crash log is not written in the event of a crash.

Startup and Preferences
   When the ``bpy`` module loads it contains the default startup scene
   (instead of an "empty" blend-file as you might expect), so there is a default cube, camera and light.

   If you wish to start from an empty file use: ``bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)``.

   The users startup and preferences are ignored to prevent your local configuration from impacting scripts behavior.
   The Python module behaves as if ``--factory-startup`` was passed as a command line argument.

   The users preferences and startup can be loaded using operators:

   .. code-block:: python

      import bpy

      bpy.ops.wm.read_userpref()
      bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile()


Limitations
===========

Most constraints of Blender as an application still apply:

Reloading Unsupported
   Reloading the ``bpy`` module via ``importlib.reload`` will raise an exception
   instead of reloading and resetting the module.

   Instead, the operator ``bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings()`` can be used to reset the internal state.

Single Blend File Restriction
   Only a single ``.blend`` file can be edited at a time.

   .. hint::

      As with the application it's possible to start multiple instances,
      each with their own ``bpy`` and therefor Blender state.
      Python provides the ``multiprocessing`` module to make communicating with sub-processes more convenient.

      In some cases the library API may be an alternative to starting separate processes,
      although this API operates on reading and writing ID data-blocks and isn't
      a complete substitute for loading ``.blend`` files, see:

      - :meth:`bpy.types.BlendDataLibraries.load`
      - :meth:`bpy.types.BlendDataLibraries.write`
      - :meth:`bpy.types.BlendData.temp_data`
        supports a temporary data-context to avoid manipulating the current ``.blend`` file.
