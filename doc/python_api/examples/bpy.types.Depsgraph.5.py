Dependency graph: bpy.data.meshes.new_from_object()
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Object.to_mesh() is closely interacting with dependency graph: its behavior depends on whether it
is used on original or evaluated object.

When is used on original object, the result mesh is calculated from the object without taking
animation or modifiers into account:

- For meshes this is similar to duplicating the source mesh.
- For curves this disables own modifiers, and modifiers of objects used as bevel and taper.
- For metaballs this produces an empty mesh since polygonization is done as a modifier evaluation.

When is used on evaluated object all modifiers are taken into account.

All the references (such as materials) are re-mapped to original. This ensures validity and
consistency of the main database.

.. note:: The result mesh is added to the main database.
.. note:: If object does not have geometry (i.e. camera) the functions returns None.
