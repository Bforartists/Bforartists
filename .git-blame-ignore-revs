# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# After running the above, commits listed in this file will be
# ignored by git blame. The blame will be shifted to the person
# who edited the line(s) before the ignored commit.
#
# To disable this ignorance for a command, run as follows
# git blame --ignore-revs-file="" <other options>
#
# Changes that belong here:
# - Massive comment, doxy-sections, or spelling corrections.
# - Clang-format, PEP8 or other automated changes which are *strictly* "no functional change".
# - Several smaller commits should be added to this list at once, because adding
#   one extra commit (to edit this file) after every small cleanup is noisy.
#
# Note:
# - The comment above the SHA should be the first line of the commit.
# - It is fine to pack together similar commits if they have the same explanatory comment.
# - Use only 40 character git SHAs; not smaller ones, not prefixed with rB.
