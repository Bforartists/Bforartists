# Bforartists
Bforartists is a fork of the popular 3D software Blender, with the goal to change various aspects of the UI to increase the usability.

To give you an idea what it is about, here you can find the initial UI design doc from autumn 2015.  http://www.bforartists.de/data/Bforartists_UI_redesign_Designdoc_Part%201_-_general.pdf

Note that it is in big parts outdated already. Development has changed lots of it. Some things are implemented in a different way than initially thought, some things turned out to be unmanageable. Like implementing Qt as the new UI solution. But lots of things have already made their way into Bforartists. And more will follow. The goal is to get as close as possible to the rough goal of this document.

The precompiled libraries for WINDOWS can be downloaded here for now: www.bforartists.de/data/dev/lib.tar.gz . 2.5 Gb.
