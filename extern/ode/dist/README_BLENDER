Checked out from ODE cvs (http://q12.org) on or around

Note that ODE has its own build system. The source/ode/
directory is traversed by Blender's source/Makefile. However
source/ode/config/user-settings has to be set correctly
depending on the target platform. This needs to be done in the
source/Makefile which determines the proper platform, then copies
the appropriate platform-specific user-settings.platform file to
source/ode/config/user-settings. Currently source/ode/user-settings is
for Linux.

Don't change the source in this directory. This source code is
maintained on the CVS server at http://q12.org and is provided here
so that Blender developers can compile ODE without having to separately
download and install it. This source code can and should periodically
be synchronized (manually) with the source code at http://q12.org.
