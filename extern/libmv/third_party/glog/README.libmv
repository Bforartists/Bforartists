Upgrading Notes
* Replace <gflags/gflags.h> with "third_party/gflags/gflags/gflags.h" which is easier
  to setup things in libmv and also helps with setting up building libmv into
  external applications.
* Replace "glog/logging.h" and  "glog/logging.h" with <glog/logging.h> and  <glog/logging.h>
  which is needed on Windows platform because otherwise files like logging.cc will be using
  relative path which points to headers used by linux instead of headers need to be used
  on Windows.
* Replace _asm int 3 with __debugbreak(). Such assembler code is obsolete and doesn't work
  with 64bit versions of MSVC compilers.
* Do not use stacktrace for MinGW and FreeBSD because it leads into issues accessing
  some specific data on this platforms.
* Define HAVE_LIB_GFLAGS for Windows builds.
* Do not define __declspec(dllimport) for MinGW platforms.
* Setup proper includes and datatypes for int32, uint32, int64 and uint64 for MinGW
* Do not define va_copy for MinGW platforms (it's already defined there).
* Patch localtime_r to be working fine with MinGW, disable strerror_r for MinGW because
  of lack of needed functions.
* Added -fPIC flag, so shared libraries from Ceres could be linked against static glog
