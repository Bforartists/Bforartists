    CompressedRowSparseMatrix::AppendRows and DeleteRows bugfix.
    
    CompressedRowSparseMatrix can store the row and column block structure
    but the AppendRows and DeleteRows methods did not pay attention to them.
    This meant that it was possible to get to a CompressedRowSparseMatrix
    whose block structure did not match the contents of the matrix.
    
    This change fixes this problem.

    Handle empty problems consistently.
    
    Until now Ceres was inconsistent in the way it handled a solve
    call on an "empty" Problem. If the problem did not contain
    any residual or parameter blocks, it failed. However, if after
    constructing the reduced program, the problem was found to not
    contain any modifiable parameter blocks, it was considered a valid
    problem which had a constant objective function value.
    
    When creating problems automatically, it is often the case that
    an empty problem is a corner case. This change makes handling this
    corner case consistent with the rest of Ceres logic.

    Consolidate SolverTerminationType enum.
    
    1. Rename SolverTerminationType to TerminationType.
    2. Consolidate the enum as
      a. CONVERGENCE - subsumes FUNCTION_TOLERANCE, PARAMETER_TOLERANCE and GRADIENT_TOLERANCE
      b. NO_CONVERGENCE
      c. FAILURE - captures all kinds of failures including DID_NOT_RUN.
      d. USER_SUCCESS
      e. USER_FAILURE
    3. Solver::Summary::error is renamed to be Solver::Summary::message, to both
    reduce confusion as well as capture its true meaning.

    Made collections port compatible with MSVC2008
    
    The issue was caused by the fact that in this version
    of MSVC unordered_map class is defined in <unordered_map>
    header file, but this file declares the class int std::tr1
    namespace.
    
    This confused existing assumption that if there's an
    existing <unordered_map> file then class is declared
    in std namespace.
    
    Added an extra check to CMake which detects whether
    it's std or std::tr1 which actually contains class
    of unordered_map.

    Restore the state of the Problem after a call to Evaluate.
    
    Calling Problem::Evaluate mutates the state of the parameter blocks.
    In particular, depending on the set and order of parameter blocks
    passed to the evaluate call, it will change the internal indexing
    used by the Program object used by ProblemImpl. This needs to be
    undone before Evaluate returns, otherwise the Problem object
    is in an invalid state.
    
    To help with testing and debugging in the future, a new method
    Program::IsValid has been added which checks whether the problem
    has its parameter and residual blocks in the right state.
    
    Thanks to Stefan Leutenegger for reporting this.

    - Previously we relied on FindPackage() to define Ceres_FOUND when

    We now require that the first derivative of the loss function

    the second order correction suggested by BANS and instead use
    a simpler first order strategy which does not use a division by
    the gradient of the loss function.

    Removing incorrect specialisation of install dirs on Windows.
    
    - Previously on Windows the leaf include & lib install directories
      passed to CeresConfig.cmake.in when configured where capitalised on
      Windows.
    - This capitalisation was incorrect, as the actual paths used are
      specified in the install() statements and are always in the standard
      lower-case form.
    - This likely did not cause any issues previously as although NTFS is
      case sensitive, the Win32 API is not, and most applications access
      files through the Win32 API, and are thus not case-sensitive.

    Fix ordering of ParseCommandLineFlags() & InitGoogleTest() for Windows.
    
    - On Windows gtest passes additional non-gflags command line flags
      for death-tests, to avoid gflags invoking an error for these flags
      InitGoogleTest() must be called before ParseCommandLineFlags() to
      handle and remove them before gflags parses the remaining flags.

    Speed up the application of robust loss functions.
    
    Since we added special handling for the case for rho[2] < 0,
    the bulk of CorrectJacobian is pointless in the common case.
    So add a simple one dimensional loop which rescales the Jacobian.
    This speeds up this method immensely.
    
    The robustification of a Jacobian gets speeded up by > 50%.

    Remove DCHECK_GE checks from fixed_array.h
    
    This triggers -Wtype-limits warnings on comparisons
    which are always true, since the test being done is
    n >= 0, where n is of type size_t, which is always
    true.
    
    This causes problems when compiling Ceres on linux
    with miniglog.

    Downgrading warning messages when optional deps are not found.
    
    - Now when find_package() is called for a dependency without the
      REQUIRED or QUIET qualifiers, we emit no priority (above STATUS, but
      below WARNING) messages and continue.

    Fix FindPackage scripts to emit warnings, not errors if not found.
    
    - Previously we used message priority: SEND_ERROR when a package was
      not found and find_package() was called without QUIET or REQUIRED,
      which emits an error message, and prevents generation, but continues
      configuration.
    - The fact SEND_ERROR induces an error message was confusing for users
      as it implies that something bad has happened and they cannot
      continue, when in fact we were disabling the option in question
      and were thus able to continue, all they had to do was re-configure.
    
    - This commit also reorders the search lists for includes/libraries
      so that we always search user installed locations (e.g. /usr/local)
      before system installed locations.  Thus we will now always prefer
      a user install to a system install if both are available, which is
      likely to be the users desired intention.

    Fixing CXSparse include directories statement.
    
    - Reported as issue #135:
      https://code.google.com/p/ceres-solver/issues/detail?id=135.
    - CXSPARSE_INCLUDE was the legacy include directory variable, since
      the buildsystem updates we now use the CMake standard:
      CXSPARSE_INCLUDE_DIRS.

    Fix compilation in Visual C++ 2013.
    
    I had to fix the following things to make Ceres compile in 2013:
     * Not link to 'm' (GNU math library).
     * Excplicitly convert an std::ostream to bool.
     * Include <algorithm> for std::max.

    Add support for multiple visibility clustering algorithms.
    
    The original visibility based preconditioning paper and
    implementation only used the canonical views algorithm.
    
    This algorithm for large dense graphs can be particularly
    expensive. As its worst case complexity is cubic in size
    of the graph.
    
    Further, for many uses the SCHUR_JACOBI preconditioner
    was both effective enough while being cheap. It however
    suffers from a fatal flaw. If the camera parameter blocks
    are split between two or more parameter blocks, e.g,
    extrinsics and intrinsics. The preconditioner because
    it is block diagonal will not capture the interactions
    between them.
    
    Using CLUSTER_JACOBI or CLUSTER_TRIDIAGONAL will fix
    this problem but as mentioned above this can be quite
    expensive depending on the problem.
    
    This change extends the visibility based preconditioner
    to allow for multiple clustering algorithms. And adds
    a simple thresholded single linkage clustering algorithm
    which allows you to construct versions of CLUSTER_JACOBI
    and CLUSTER_TRIDIAGONAL preconditioners that are cheap
    to construct and are more effective than SCHUR_JACOBI.
    
    Currently the constants controlling the threshold above
    which edges are considered in the single linkage algorithm
    are not exposed. This would be done in a future change.
