    Faster  BlockRandomAccessSparseMatrix::SymmetricRightMultiply.
    
    Trade a small amount of memory to improve the cache coherency of
    the SymmetricRightMultiply operation.
    
    The resulting code leads to a 10-20% speedup in the linear solver
    end to end.

    Let ITERATIVE_SCHUR use an explicit Schur Complement matrix.
    
    Up till now ITERATIVE_SCHUR evaluates matrix-vector products
    between the Schur complement and a vector implicitly by exploiting
    the algebraic expression for the Schur complement.
    
    This cost of this evaluation scales with the number of non-zeros
    in the Jacobian.
    
    For small to medium sized problems there is a sweet spot where
    computing the Schur complement is cheap enough that it is much
    more efficient to explicitly compute it and use it for evaluating
    the matrix-vector products.
    
    This changes implements support for an explicit Schur complement
    in ITERATIVE_SCHUR in combination with the SCHUR_JACOBI preconditioner.
    
    API wise a new bool Solver::Options::use_explicit_schur_complement
    has been added.
    
    The implementation extends the SparseSchurComplementSolver to use
    Conjugate Gradients.
    
    Example speedup:
    
    use_explicit_schur_complement = false
    
    Time (in seconds):
    Preprocessor                            0.585
    
      Residual evaluation                   0.319
      Jacobian evaluation                   1.590
      Linear solver                        25.685
    Minimizer                              27.990
    
    Postprocessor                           0.010
    Total                                  28.585
    
    use_explicit_schur_complement = true
    
    Time (in seconds):
    Preprocessor                            0.638
    
      Residual evaluation                   0.318
      Jacobian evaluation                   1.507
      Linear solver                         5.930
    Minimizer                               8.144
    
    Postprocessor                           0.010
    Total                                   8.791
    
    Which indicates an end-to-end speedup of more than 3x, with the linear
    solver being sped up by > 4x.
    
    The idea to explore this optimization was inspired by the recent paper:
    
    Mining structure fragments for smart bundle adjustment
    L. Carlone, P. Alcantarilla, H. Chiu, K. Zsolt, F. Dellaert
    British Machine Vision Conference, 2014
    
    which uses a more complicated algorithm to compute parts of the
    Schur complement to speed up the matrix-vector product.

    Fix unused-function warning with Eigen < 3.2.2.
    
    - CreateBlockJacobian() is only ever used when Eigen >= 3.2.2 is
      detected, but was previously defined whenever CERES_USE_EIGEN_SPARSE
      was defined with no check on the Eigen version.
    - This resulted in an unused-function compile warning that became an
      error due to -Werror, preventing compilation when using Eigen < 3.2.2.

    Add GradientProblem and GradientProblemSolver.
    
    The line search minimizer in Ceres does not require that the
    problems that is solving is a sum of squares. Over the past
    year there have been multiple requests to expose this algorithm
    on its own so that it can be used to solve unconstrained
    non-linear minimization problems on its own.
    
    With this change, a new optimization problem called
    GradientProblem is introduced which is basically a thin
    wrapper around a user defined functor that evaluates cost
    and gradients (FirstOrderFunction) and an optional LocalParameterization.
    
    Corresponding to it, a GradientProblemSolver and its associated
    options and summary structs are introduced too.
    
    An example that uses the new API to find the minimum of Rosenbrock's
    function is also added.

    Fix Eigen Row/ColMajor bug in NumericDiffCostFunction.
    
    If the parameter block size is 1, asking Eigen to create

    Fix crash in Covariance if # threads > 1 requested without OpenMP.
    
    - Previously if options.num_threads > 1 was given to Covariance compiled
      without OpenMP, a CHECK() would be triggered in program_evalutor.

    Add an unweighted graph.
    
    Rename Graph -> WeightedGraph.
    Add a new Graph class, which is cheaper to construct and
    work with if the weights are not needed.
    
    This cuts down the cost of building the Hessian graph
    significantly.

    Fixed MSVC error C2124: divide or mod by zero
    
    Alternatively, if quiet_NaN is not available on all platforms a workaround would be:
        volatile double zero = 0.0;
        double x = 1.0/zero;
    The 'volatile' is needed to shut up "warning C4723: potential divide by 0".

    Fix a bug in TrustRegionPreprocessor
    
    TrustRegionPreprocessor was not setting Minimizer::Options::is_constrained.
    This meant that the line search for bounds constraints was not being
    invoked for bounds constrained problems.
    
    And some minor lint cleanup.

    Refactor SolverImpl.
    
    Replace SolverImpl with
    
     a. A minimizer specific preprocessor class.
     b. A generic Solve function inside solver.cc
     c. Presummarize and Postsummarize functions to handle
        updates to the summary object.
    
    The existing SolverImpl class was a mixture of the above three
    things and was increasingly complicated code to follow. This change,
    breaks it into its three separate constituents, with the aims of
    better separation of concerns and thus better testability and
    reliability.
    
    The call to Solver::Solve() now consists of
    
    1. Presummarize - summarize the given state of the problem and solver
       options.
    2. Preprocess - Setup everything that is needed to call the minimizer.
       This includes, removing redundant parameter and residual blocks,
       setting up the reordering for the linear solver, creating the
       linear solver, evaluator, inner iteration minimizer etc.
    3. Minimize.
    4. Post summarize - summarize the result of the preprocessing and the
       solve.

    Preprocessor for the TrustRegionMinimizer.
    
    1. Base class for preprocessors.
    2. A preprocessor for problems that will be solved using

    3. Added sanity tests to the program reordering options
       for Schur type linear solvers.
    4. Tests for the TrustRegionPreprocessor.

    Change ownership of pointers in Minimizer::Options.
    
    This is a intermediate change to clean things up
    in preparation for a broader refactoring of the SolverImpl.
    
    Essentially we are replacing raw pointers in Minimizer::Options
    with shared_ptr objects. For now this only makes things a bit
    more complicated looking inside solver_impl.cc, but going
    forward this will lead to considerable simplifications in
    tracking ownership of various pointers.

    GradientCheckingProblem's parameter blocks are initialized correctly.
    
    Ensure that when a new problem object is constructed for validing
    gradients, the parameter blocks have their data pointers point to
    the user's parameter blocks.
    
    We used to do this inside solver_impl.cc, but doing this at
    construction is the right thing to do.
