    Better error checking and reporting for linear solvers.
    
    A lot of error checking cruft has accumulated over the years
    in the various linear solvers. This change makes the error reporting
    more robust and consistent across the various solvers.
    
    Preconditioners are not covered by this change and will be the
    subject of a future change.

    Use explicit formula to solve quadratic polynomials.
    
    polynomial.cc implements a companion matrix base method for solving
    polynomials. This is both expensive and numerically sensitive.
    
    This change adds a quadratic equation solver. Instead of using the
    usual quadratic formula, it uses the formula suggested by BKP Horn
    for improved numerical stability.

    Fix constant parameter handling in inner iterations.
    
    There was a bug in the way RemoveFixedBlocksFromProgram was working.
    It only removed the constant parameter blocks from the
    linear_solver_ordering, it was not even aware of the
    inner_iteration_ordering.
    
    This change fixes this bug. The code for RemoveFixedBlocksFromProgram
    is also cleaned up and made more readable and the test have been updated.

    Defining CERES_FOUND in addition to Ceres_FOUND in CeresConfig.
    
    - Previously we relied on FindPackage() to define Ceres_FOUND when
      find_package(Ceres) was called.
    - This is fine, but users might legitimately expect the variable to be
      CERES_FOUND given the form of CERES_INCLUDE_DIRS/LIBRARIES.
    - As there is an inconsistency in the CMake recommended names when
      FindPackage() is called in Module vs Config form, we now explicltly
      define both.

    Relax the requirements on loss functiond derivatives.
    
    We now require that the first derivative of the loss function
    be positive only if the second derivative is non-zero. This is
    because when the second derivative is non-positive, we do not use
    the second order correction suggested by BANS and instead use
    a simpler first order strategy which does not use a division by
    the gradient of the loss function.

    - Fix bug whereby we would mark a step size as satisfying the Wolfe
      conditions when it did not due to numerical issues in the cost
      function.

      acceptably invoked with bracket_low.f > bracket_high.f.

      conditional return if not satisfied to address issue whereby a
      bracket could be incorrectly identified due to inconsistent values
      & gradients returned from the cost function.

    Removing incorrect specialisation of install dirs on Windows.
    
    - Previously on Windows the leaf include & lib install directories
      passed to CeresConfig.cmake.in when configured where capitalised on
      Windows.
    - This capitalisation was incorrect, as the actual paths used are
      specified in the install() statements and are always in the standard
      lower-case form.
    - This likely did not cause any issues previously as although NTFS is
      case sensitive, the Win32 API is not, and most applications access
      files through the Win32 API, and are thus not case-sensitive.

    Fix FindPackage scripts to emit warnings, not errors if not found.
    
    - Previously we used message priority: SEND_ERROR when a package was
      not found and find_package() was called without QUIET or REQUIRED,
      which emits an error message, and prevents generation, but continues
      configuration.
    - The fact SEND_ERROR induces an error message was confusing for users
      as it implies that something bad has happened and they cannot
      continue, when in fact we were disabling the option in question
      and were thus able to continue, all they had to do was re-configure.
    
    - This commit also reorders the search lists for includes/libraries
      so that we always search user installed locations (e.g. /usr/local)
      before system installed locations.  Thus we will now always prefer
      a user install to a system install if both are available, which is
      likely to be the users desired intention.

    - Reported as issue #135:
      https://code.google.com/p/ceres-solver/issues/detail?id=135.
    - CXSPARSE_INCLUDE was the legacy include directory variable, since
      the buildsystem updates we now use the CMake standard:
      CXSPARSE_INCLUDE_DIRS.

    Fix compilation in Visual C++ 2013.
    
    I had to fix the following things to make Ceres compile in 2013:
     * Not link to 'm' (GNU math library).
     * Excplicitly convert an std::ostream to bool.
     * Include <algorithm> for std::max.

    Add support for multiple visibility clustering algorithms.
    
    The original visibility based preconditioning paper and
    implementation only used the canonical views algorithm.
    
    This algorithm for large dense graphs can be particularly
    expensive. As its worst case complexity is cubic in size
    of the graph.
    
    Further, for many uses the SCHUR_JACOBI preconditioner
    was both effective enough while being cheap. It however
    suffers from a fatal flaw. If the camera parameter blocks
    are split between two or more parameter blocks, e.g,
    extrinsics and intrinsics. The preconditioner because
    it is block diagonal will not capture the interactions
    between them.
    
    Using CLUSTER_JACOBI or CLUSTER_TRIDIAGONAL will fix
    this problem but as mentioned above this can be quite
    expensive depending on the problem.
    
    This change extends the visibility based preconditioner
    to allow for multiple clustering algorithms. And adds
    a simple thresholded single linkage clustering algorithm
    which allows you to construct versions of CLUSTER_JACOBI
    and CLUSTER_TRIDIAGONAL preconditioners that are cheap
    to construct and are more effective than SCHUR_JACOBI.
    
    Currently the constants controlling the threshold above
    which edges are considered in the single linkage algorithm
    are not exposed. This would be done in a future change.

    Export the structure of a problem to the public API
    
    This adds three new public methods to ceres::Problem:
    
      Problem::GetResidualBlocks()
      Problem::GetParameterBlocksForResidualBlock()
      Problem::GetResidualBlocksForParameterBlock()
    
    These permit access to the underlying graph structure of the problem.

    Move CERES_HASH_NAMESPACE macros to collections_port.h
    
    Now that we have a clearer understanding of the naming rules
    there is no need for these macro definitions to be done in
    the cmake file.
    
    This cleans up the compilation command line.

    Fix handling of unordered_map/unordered_set on OSX 10.9.0.
    
    Depending on the compiler + standard library combination,
    unordered_map/set may or may not be available. If available
    they maybe in the std or the std::tr1 namespaces.
    
    Apple switched to using libc++ with 10.9.0 which places
    unordered_map in std, breaking our assumptions about the
    platform.
    
    This change refactors our logic for dealing with the namespace
    switching, making it a three state thing rather than two. There
    are three defines now, CERES_NO_UNORDERED_MAP, CERES_STD_UNORDERED_MAP
    and CERES_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP. Earlier the first two were conflated
    into one, leading to the breakage.

    Fix AngleAxisToRotationMatrix near zero.
    
    The Taylor series approximation had its sign flipped and the
    tests did not catch it since we were switching exactly at zero,
    which was not getting triggered.
    
    This changes modifies the tolerance, adds a test that triggers
    and fixes the bug.
    
    Thanks to Michael Samples for reporting this.

    Add BlockRandomAccessDiagonalMatrix.
    
    This class is used in the SchurJacobiPreconditioner for
    storing the preconditioner matrix. Using it speeds up
    the computation of the preconditioner by ~15% due to
    the elimination of a hash table lookup.

    Adding explicit link to libm for pure-C curve fitting example.
    
    - Any pure-C program #including <math.h> will need to link against
      libm, some compilers will let an indirect link slide (via Ceres in
      this case) but some won't.
