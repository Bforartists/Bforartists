Local modifications:

  * Added
      SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "")
    to CMakeLists.txt to prevent warnings from being treated as errors.
  * Fixed "unused variable" in the header files.  Warnings in the cpps files 
    are still there.
  * Fixed a bug in CameraMatrix::opticalAxis() in file
    Geometry/v3d_cameramatrix.h
  * Deleted the Dataset directory.
  * Added '#include <string>' to ssba/Apps/bundle_common.cpp and
    ssba/Apps/bundle_varying.cpp to stop undefined references to strcmp
  * Removed unnecessary elements from the CMakeLists.txt file, including the
    obsoleted local_config.cmake and friends.
  * Added a virtual destructor to V3D::LevenbergOptimizerCommon in
    Math/v3d_optimization.h
  * Added /EHsc WIN32-specific flag to CMakeLists.txt
  * Remove unused variable Vector3d np in bundle_common.cpp and bundle_varying (in main() function).
