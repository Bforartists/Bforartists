Project: Google Flags
URL: http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/
License: New BSD
Upstream version: 2.0
Local modifications:

- Flattened the tree and only included files needed for libmv. This involved
  changing some of the includes to point to the current directory instead of a
  nested gflags directory.

- Added a poor-man's version of upstream's port.cc/h to make gflags compile on
  windows. This isn't sufficient but is a stopgap for now.

  TODO(keir): Import and use gflags for Windows from upstream.
