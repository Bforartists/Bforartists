    Fix bad memory write in BA code when having zero-weighted tracks
    
    Issue was really stupid and caused by the wrong vector initialization.

    Implement separate BA step for tracks which have constant zero weight
    
    This is needed to minimize their reprojection error over the footage.
    Without this extra step positions of such tracks were calculated by
    algebraic intersection code only, which doesn't give best precision.

    Avoid zero-sized problem when doing euclidean intersection
    
    Zero-sized problem might occur when intersecting track with
    constant zero weight. For such tracks we'll just use result
    of algebraic intersection.
    
    TODO: We probably need to have a separate BA step to adjust
    positions of tracks with constant zero weight.

    Ignore zero weighted markers in keyframe selection
    
    It doesn't make sense to use zero-weighted tracks as a correspondences
    in keyframe selection.
    
    Such tracks are not guaranteed to be tracked accurately because their
    purpose is to add reference points in 3D space without affecting the
    solution.

    Tweaks to make bundling into Blender warning-less
    
    Mainly issue i caused by conflicts in include directories,
    so glog used to include config.h from gflags. It might be
    fixed by splitting gflags/glog from Libmv in Blender build
    system but that's not something fun to work on. Fixed by

    Also solved no-previous-prototype warnings.

    Made it possible to link against Ceres installed on the system
    
    Main purpose of this is to get away from bundled Ceres library
    which is not so trivial to re-bundle and takes some to do this
    (not talking about CMake options conflicts and pollution).
    
    Enabled by setting WITH_SYSTEM_CERES=ON. Default paths to search
    Ceres library:
    
    - /usr/local
    - /sw
    - /opt/local
    - /opt/csw
    - /opt/lib/ceres
    
    You might also specify Ceres root directory using CERES_ROOT_DIR
    variable (both CMake and environment variables are supported).
    
    If your Ceres is build statically, you're to control all additional
    libraries needed to link against using CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS.

    scoped_array is pretty much the same as scoped_ptr
    with the only difference that it'll free memory using
    delete[] operator.
    
    It also gives some additional API functions to access
    array elements.
    
    Currently it only used to manage images denoted as byte
    arrays in detector.

    Improvements to weighted tracks behavior
    
    First thing changed by this commit is making it so
    Euclidean intersection takes track weight into account
    when solving minimization problem. This behaves the
    same exact way as it is for BA step.
    
    Second thing is related on how average reprojection error
    is being calculated. It didn't take track weight into
    account which could confuse users. Now average reprojection
    error will give the same result as intersection/BA uses
    during minimization which gives much more predictable
    behavior.

    Fixes for keyframe selection
    
    Using tracks with constant zero weight used to crash
    keyframe selection since it was trying to use missing
    parameter blocks for Jacobian evaluation,
    
    Also fixed possible issues with wrong camera block being
    marked as variable. This could technically happen when
    having zero weighted tracks. Made it so all camera blocks
    are marked as variable for now.

    Switch the detector API to a single function which accepts
    a float image and detector options. This makes usage of
    feature detection more unified across different algorithms.
    
    Options structure is pretty much straightforward and contains
    detector to be used and all the detector-specific settings.

    is not as fast as FAST one but is expected to detect more

    Eagerly attempt to refine a track before doing a brute search
    
    Before the refinement phase of tracking, a brute force SAD search
    is run across the search area. This works well but is slow;
    especially if the guess for the track's location is accurate.
    
    This patch runs a refinement phase before running a brute force
    search, hoping that the guessed position (in x2, y2) is close to
    the best answer. If it is, then no brute search is done. If it is
    not, then a normal brute force search followed by refinement is
    done.
    
    In some cases this may produce worse tracks than before; the
    regressions will need investigation. The predictive motion model
    (to be implemented) will reduce the probability of that happening.

    Before this patch, if Ceres returned USER_SUCCESS indicating that
    Ceres was only changing the tracked quad slightly between
    iterations (indicating convergence), no final correlation check
    was done. This leads to incorrectly returning that the tracking
    was successful, when it actually failed.

    Implement refinement of estimated homography/fundamental matrices
    
    It was only possible to perform algebraic estimation, which didn't
    give so much accurate results.
    
    Implemented a way to perform algebraic estimation followed with
    refinement step using Ceres minimizer.
    
    The code was actually mostly already there since keyframe selection
    patch. Made such estimation a generic function in multiview/ and
    hanged API for estimation in order to pass all additional options via
    an options structure (the same way as it's done fr Ceres).
    
    Most of the options are straight-forward to understand,but some
    deserves more description here:
    
    * expected_average_symmetric_distance is used as an early output check
      and as soon as average symmetric error goes below this threshold
      refining finishes.
    
      This distance is measured in the same units as input points are.
    
      It is arguable whether we need callback for this or not, but seems
      Ceres doesn't have some kind of absolute threshold for function value
      and function_tolerance behaves different from logic behind expected
      symmetric error.
    
    * There' an option to normalize correspondences before estimating the
      homography in order to increase estimation stability. See

    Add Procrustes PNP ("PPnP") resection algorithm to libmv
    
    This adds a new Euclidean resection method, used to create the
    initial reconstruction in the motion tracker, to libmv. The method
    is based on the Procrustes PNP algorithm (aka "PPnP"). Currently
    the algorithm is not connected with the motion tracker, but it
    will be eventually since it supports initialization.
    
    Having an initial guess when doing resection is important for
    ambiguous cases where potentially the user could offer extra
    guidance to the solver, in the form of "this point is in front of
    that point".

    Keyframe selection improvements
    
    Added additional criteria, which ignores
    keyframe pair if success intersection factor
    is lower than current candidate pair factor.
    
    This solves issue with keyframe pair at which
    most of the tracks are intersecting behind the
    camera is accepted (because variance in this
    case is really small),
    
    Also tweaked generalized inverse function,
    which now doesn't scale epsilon by maximal
    matrix element. This gave issues at really bad
    candidates with unstable covariance. In this
    case almost all eigen values getting zeroed
    on inverse leading to small expected error.

    Keyframe selection code cleanup
    
    - Updated comments in code.
    - Removed currently unused functions.
      Actually, they'd better be moved to some generic
      logging module, but we don't have it now so was
      lazy to create one now. Could happen later using
      code from git history
    - Renamed function to match better to what's going
      on in it.

    Optimization for reconstruction variance
    
    Achieved by replacing SVD-based pseudo-inverse with
    an eigen solver pseudo inverse.
    
    New function works in the same way: it decomposes
    matrix to V*D*V^-1, then inverts diagonal of D
    and composes matrix back.
    
    The same way is used to deal with gauges - last
    7 eigen values are getting zeroed.
    
    In own tests gives approx 2x boost, without
    visible affect on selected keyframe quality.
