/*!
    Track \a pattern in \a image.

    This template matcher computes the
    \link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_absolute_differences Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) \endlink
    for each integer pixel position in the search region and then iteratively
    refine subpixel position using a square search.
    A similar method is used for motion estimation in video encoders.

    \a pattern is a 16x16 single channel image to track.
    \a x, \a y is the initial estimated position in \a image.
    On return, \a x, \a y is the tracked position.
    \a image is a reference to the single channel image to search.
    \a stride is size of \a image lines.

    \note For a 16x speedup, compile this tracker with SSE2 support.
    \note \a stride allow you to reference your search region instead of copying.

    \return Sum of absolute difference between reference and matched pattern.
            A lower value indicate a better match. Divide this sum by the pattern area (16x16)
            to compute the per pixel deviation (0=perfect match, 255=worst match).
