    This template matcher computes the

    for each integer pixel position in the search region and then iteratively
    refine subpixel position using a square search.
    A similar method is used for motion estimation in video encoders.

    \a reference is the pattern to track.
    \a warped is a warped version of reference for fast unsampled integer search.
       Best is to directly extract an already warped pattern from previous frame.
    The \a size of the patterns should be aligned to 16.
    \a image is a reference to the region to search.
    \a stride is size of \a image lines.

    On input, \a warp is the predicted affine transformation (e.g from previous frame)
    On return, \a warp is the affine transformation which best match the reference \a pattern

    \a areaPenalty and conditionPenalty control the regularization and need to be tweaked depending on the motion.
       Setting them to 0 will allow any transformation (including unrealistic distortions and scaling).
       Good values are between 0-32. 16 can be used as a realistic default.
       areaPenalty control scaling (decrease to allow pull/zoom, increase to allow only 2D rotation).
       a large conditionPenalty avoid a large ratio between the largest and smallest axices.
       It need to be decreased for non-2D rotation (when pattern appears to scale along an axis).

    \return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between reference and matched pattern.
            This measure of the linear dependence between the patterns
            ranges from âˆ’1 (negative correlation) to 1 (positive correlation).
            A value of 0 implies that there is no linear correlation between the variables.

    \note To track affine features:
     - Sample reference pattern using estimated (e.g previous frame) warp.
     -
    \note \a stride allow you to reference your search region instead of copying.
    \note For a 16x speedup, compile this tracker with SSE2 support.
