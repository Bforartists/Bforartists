/**
 * @mainpage Bullet Documentation
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * Bullet Collision Detection & Physics SDK
 *
 * Bullet is a Collision Detection and Rigid Body Dynamics Library. The Library is Open Source and free for commercial use, under the ZLib license ( http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php ).
 *
 * There is the Physics Forum for Feedback and General Collision Detection and Physics discussions.
 * Please visit http://www.continuousphysics.com/Bullet/phpBB2/index.php
 *
 * @section install_sec Installation
 *
 * @subsection step1 Step 1: Download
 * You can download the Bullet Physics Library from our website: http://www.continuousphysics.com/Bullet/
 * @subsection step2 Step 2: Building
 * Bullet comes with autogenerated Project Files for Microsoft Visual Studio 6, 7, 7.1 and 8.
 * The main Workspace/Solution is located in Bullet/msvc/8/wksbullet.sln (replace 8 with your version).
 * 
 * Under other platforms, like Linux or Mac OS-X, Bullet can be build using jam, http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html .
 * Jam is a build system that can build the library, demos and also autogenerate the MSVC Project Files.
 * So if you are not using MSVC, you can run configure and jam .
 * If you don't have jam installed, you can make jam from the included jam-2.5 sources, or download jam from ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam/
 * 
 * @subsection step3 Step 3: Testing demos
 * Try to run and experiment with CcdPhysicsDemo executable as a starting point.
 * Bullet can be used in several ways, as Full Rigid Body simulation, as Collision Detector Library or Low Level / Snippets like the GJK Closest Point calculation.
 * The Dependencies can be seen in this documentation under Directories
 * 
 * @subsection step4 Step 4: Integrating in your application, Full Rigid Body Simulation
 * Check out CcdPhysicsDemo how to create a CcdPhysicsEnvironment , CollisionShape and RigidBody, Stepping the simulation and synchronizing your derived version of the PHY_IMotionState class.
 * @subsection step5 Step 5 : Integrate the Collision Detection Library (without Dynamics and other Extras)
 * Bullet Collision Detection can also be used without the Dynamics/Extras.
 * Check out CollisionWorld and CollisionObject, and the CollisionInterfaceDemo. Also in Extras/test_BulletOde.cpp there is a sample Collision Detection integration with Open Dynamics Engine, ODE, http://www.ode.org
 * @subsection step6 Step 6 : Use Snippets like the GJK Closest Point calculation.
 * Bullet has been designed in a modular way keeping dependencies to a minimum. The ConvexHullDistance demo demonstrates direct use of GjkPairDetector.
