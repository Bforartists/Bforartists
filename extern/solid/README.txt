		 SOLID - Software Library for Interference Detection

SOLID is a software library containing functions for performing
intersection tests and proximity queries that are useful in the context
of collision detection. Collision detection is the process of detecting
pairs of geometric objects that are intersecting or are within a given
proximity of each other. In particular, SOLID is useful for detecting
collisions between objects that are moving relatively of each other over
time. The motions of objects are controlled by the client application,
and are not determined or affected by SOLID.
