This is a redcode decoder written solely by looking at some
R3D files that are floating around on the web.

This decoder works with the files I tested, but I don't give
any guarantee (especially, if RED decides to change the
file format).

That said: I found it a really nice idea of them, to make
such a clear and comprehensible file layout.

Choosing JPEG2000 as an encoding format and the way, they
did YCbCr encoding of the sensor data is simply brilliant.

My approach of decoding the sensor data is probably not
so brilliant, but seems to work rather nicely (and sharply!).

If someone finds a better way and/or RED decides to release
specification, just go ahead and feel free to change it!

Until that happens: simply enjoy opening RED footage within Blender!
