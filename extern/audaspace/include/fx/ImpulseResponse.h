* This class represents an impulse response that can be used in convolution.
* When this class is instanced, the impulse response is divided in channels and those channels are divided in parts of N/2 samples (N being the size of the FFT plan used).
* The main objetive of this class is to allow the reutilization of an impulse response in various sounds without having to process it more than one time.
* \warning The size of the FFTPlan used to process the impulse response must be the same as the one used in the convolver classes.
