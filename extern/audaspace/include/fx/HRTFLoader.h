/**
* This loader provides a method to load all the HRTFs in one directory, provided they follow the following naming scheme:
* Example: L-10e210a.wav
* The first character refers to the ear from which the HRTF was recorded: 'L' for a left ear and 'R' for a right ear.
* Next is the elevation angle followed by the 'e' character. [-90, 90]
* Then is the azimuth angle followed by the 'a' character. [0, 360)
* For a sound source situated at the left of the listener the azimuth angle regarding the left ear is 90 while the angle regarding the right ear is 270.
* KEMAR HRTFs use this naming scheme.
