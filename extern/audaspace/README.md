=========

Audaspace (pronounced "outer space") is a high level audio library written in C++ with language bindings for Python for example. It started out as the audio engine of the 3D modelling application Blender and is now released as a standalone library.

Features
--------

The following (probably incomplete) features are supported by audaspace:

* input/output devices
 * input from microphones, line in, etc.
 * output devices including 3D audio support
* file reading/writing
* filters like low-/highpass and effects like delay, reverse or fading
* generators for simple waveforms like silence, sine and triangle
* respecification - this term is used for changing stream parameters which are
 * channel count - channel remapping
 * sample format - the library internally uses 32 bit floats
 * sample rate - resampling
* simple (superposition, joining and ping-pong aka forward-reverse) and more complex (non-linear audio editing) sequencing of sounds
