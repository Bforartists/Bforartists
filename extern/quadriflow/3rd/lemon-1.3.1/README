LEMON - a Library for Efficient Modeling and Optimization in Networks
=====================================================================

LEMON is an open source library written in C++. It provides
easy-to-use implementations of common data structures and algorithms
in the area of optimization and helps implementing new ones. The main
focus is on graphs and graph algorithms, thus it is especially
suitable for solving design and optimization problems of
telecommunication networks. To achieve wide usability its data
structures and algorithms provide generic interfaces.
