# Uncomment (and adjust) the following two lines. 'myprog' is the name
# of the final executable ('.exe' will automatically be added to the
# name on Windows) and 'myprog-main.cc' is the source code it is
# compiled from. You can add more source files separated by
# whitespaces. Moreover, you can add multiple similar blocks if you
# want to build more than one executables.

# ADD_EXECUTABLE(myprog myprog-main.cc)
