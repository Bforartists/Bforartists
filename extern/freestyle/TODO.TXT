--------

* Update help and make it display correctly
* Recode the ViewMap building - the Y junctions are not detected for smooth objects right now.
* Check the strokes strippification code. It seems some parts are inverted.
* Fix the pbuffer so that ATI cards are supported

* Merge Chain and Stroke classes (to Stroke) and improve the base of operators (select, chain, split, shade) consquently (also think about a way to easily specify the pipeline synchronization mode).
