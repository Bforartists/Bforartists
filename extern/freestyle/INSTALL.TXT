Install
-------

* UNIX/LINUX

(for a more detailed description, see doc/linuxinstall.html)

  This is quite straightforward, provided that you have all the
needed libraries properly installed (see Requirements section in
the README.TXT file). 
First, set the FREESTYLE-DIR environment variable to your 
freestyle directory and then, simply type:

$> cd "$FREESTYLE_DIR"/src
$> qmake
$> make

Note: The SWIG wrapper hasn't been included in the qmake build
cycle yet and thus has to be compiled separately, by hand:

$> cd "$FREESTYLE_DIR"/src/swig
$> make

And to run the app:

$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./lib"
$> cd "$FREESTYLE_DIR"/build/linux-g++/release/
$> ./Freestyle


* WINDOWS

 - If you downloaded the binary version:

1) unzip the package
2) run vcredist_x86.exe
3) run Freestyle.exe

- Compilation Instructions:

(for a more detailed description, including the cygwin
compilation instructions, see doc/wininstall.html)

1) launch 'makedsp.vcnet.debug.bat' in the 'src' subdir of your FREESTYLE_DIR to generate
  a .vcproj file for each sub-project
2) open 'src/Freestyle-vc8-debug.sln' with Visual Studio (tested with VC++ 8 express edition)
3) compile the whole project using 'build solution' in the 'build' menu 
4) run the app and enjoy ;)

* MAC OS X

(for a more detailed description, see doc/macosxinstall.html)

  This is quite straightforward, provided that you have all the
needed libraries properly installed (see Requirements section in
the README.TXT file). 
First, set the FREESTYLE-DIR environment variable to your 
freestyle directory and then, simply type:

$> cd "$FREESTYLE_DIR"/src
$> qmake
$> make

Note: The SWIG wrapper hasn't been included in the qmake build
cycle yet and thus has to be compiled separately, by hand:

$> cd "$FREESTYLE_DIR"/src/swig
$> make

And to run the app:

$> build_bundle.macosx.py
$> cd "$FREESTYLE_DIR"/
$> open Freestyle.App
