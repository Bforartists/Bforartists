Freestyle, a procedural line drawing system
http://freestyle.sourceforge.net

INTRODUCTION
------------
Freestyle is a software for Non-Photorealistic Line Drawing rendering
from 3D scenes. It is designed as a programmable interface to allow
maximum control over the style of the final drawing: the user
"programs" how the silhouettes and other feature lines from the 3D
model should be turned into stylized strokes using a set of
programmable operators dedicated to style description. This
programmable approach, inspired by the shading languages available in
photorealistic renderers such as Pixar's RenderMan, overcomes the
limitations of integrated software with access to a limited number of
parameters and permits the design of an infinite variety of rich and
complex styles. The system currently focuses on pure line drawing as a
first step. The style description language is Python augmented with
our set of operators.  Freestyle was developed in the framework of a
research project dedicated to the study of stylized line drawing
rendering from 3D scenes. Details about this research can be found at:
