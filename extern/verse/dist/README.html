<p>
This is the Verse protocol and sample server implementations.
</p>
<p>
For more information, see <a href="http://verse.blender.org/">the Verse web site</a>.
</p>
<h1>Building the Verse Core</h1>
<p class="note">
Note: This section is only of interest to developers, who wish to build the Verse core themselves.
If you have chosen a binary download, you will already have the server and can skip the rest
of this section.
</p>
<p>
Running "make" here will build the API library, "libverse.a" (and its
header file, "verse.h"). These two will then be used to build the
reference Verse server binary, called "verse".
</p>
<p>
If you are more comfortable with <a href="http://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>, and of course have it
installed on your system, you can type "scons" instead.
</p>

<h1>Starting the Server</h1>
<p>
The Verse server is a command-line program, without a graphical user interface.
You simply start it, and it will immediately begin listening for incoming
connections on a network socket. Here is how a typical invocation looks:
</p>
<pre class="shell">~> verse
</pre>
<p>
If you don't ask it to do otherwise, the Verse server will start listening for UDP packets
on its default port. The port number currently used by Verse is 4950.
</p>
<p class="note">
Note: This is not an official <a href="http://www.iana.org/">registered</a>, port number.
It is possible that it gets assigned to someone else, in case Verse will need to change.
</p>
<p>
You can use the following command line options to control the server's operation:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>-h</dt>
 <dd>
  Print a help text, that shows all understood options.
 </dd>
 <dt>-ms</dt>
 <dd>
  Enables master server communications to the default, built-in address. Use the -h option to learn
  what this address is. Please note that master server communication is <strong>disabled</strong> by default.
 </dd>
 <dt>-ms:ip=IP</dt>
 <dd>
  Sets a new address to use for master server communication. This also implies -ms, i.e. the server
  will try to register itself with the given master server. For details on the protocol used to do
  this, please see the <a href="http://verse.blender.org/cms/Master_Server__v2.775.0.html">spec</a>.
 </dd>
 <dt>-ms:de=DESC</dt>
 <dd>
  Sets the description to use for this server, when registering with the the master server. This is
  only used if master server communication is actually enabled. The description is expected to be a
  human-readable string, like <code>"A test server, run on a cable modem, and offline during local daytime"</code>
  or something.
 </dd>
 <dt>-ms:ta=TAGS</dt>
 <dd>
  Sets the tags to use for this server, when registering with the the master server. This is only used
  if master server communication is actually enabled. The tags consists of a comma-separated list of
  single words. Each word must begin with a letter, and contain only letters, digits, or underscore
  characters. For instance: <code>home,r6p1,linux,sweden,open</code>.
 </dd>
 <dt>-port=N</dt>
 <dd>
  Use the indicated port number, rather than the default. Note that ports below 1024 are generally
  off-limits to ordinary users. Running Verse on such a port is not recommended.
 </dd>
 <dt>-version</dt>
 <dd>
  Prints the version string of the server to the terminal, and then exits (successfully). See
  <a href="#rellab">below</a> for information how the version string is constructed.
 </dd>
</dl>
<p>
For example, here is how to start the server, register it with the default master server, and run
on port number equal to 16333:
</p>
<pre class="shell">~> ./server -ms -port=16333
</pre>
<p>
Here is a more complicated example, that uses an explicit master server address, and also sets both
the description and tags:
</p>
<pre class="shell">~> ./server -ms:ip=master.example.net -ms:de="A test server, for the documentation" -ms:ta=example,docs
</pre>
<p>
Options can occur in any order, with later options overriding earlier ones, in case of conflicts.
</p>

<h1><a name="rellab">Release Labeling</a></h1>
<p>
Verse uses a simple two-level numbering scheme to identify releases.
There is a "release number", and a "patch level" on each release. The
intent is that within a release, the API does not change and neither
should the network protocol. Between releases, we might improve the
API which will require application programmers to update their code
to stay in sync. We can do non-API-altering changes within a release
by increasing the patch level, for bug fixing and other things.
</p>
<p>
The symbols <code>V_RELEASE_NUMBER</code> and <code>V_RELEASE_PATCH</code>
are integer literals that hold the values for the API you have, and can be
used (and displayed) in application source code as you see fit. There is
also a string, <code>V_RELEASE_LABEL</code>, which is sometimes used.
</p>
<p>
To form a complete Verse version number, the above-mentioned symbols are
to be combined like so:
"r<i><code>&lt;V_RELEASE_NUMBER&gt;</code></i>p<i><code>&lt;V_RELEASE_PATCH&gt;&lt;V_RELEASE_LABEL&gt;</code></i>".
So, the following variable values:
<ul class="variables">
<li>V_RELEASE_VERSION = 2
<li>V_RELEASE_VERSION = 51
<li>V_RELEASE_LABEL = "foo"
</ul>
Would generate the version string "<code>r2p51foo</code>".
</p>
