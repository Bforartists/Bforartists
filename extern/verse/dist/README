				Verse

This is the Verse protocol and sample server implementations.

For more information, see <http://verse.blender.org/>.

Running "make" here will build the API library, "libverse.a" (and its
header file, "verse.h"). These two will then be used to build the
reference Verse server binary, called "verse".


RELEASE LABELING
Verse uses a simple two-level numbering scheme to identify releases.
There is a "release number", and a "patch level" on each release. The
intent is that within a release, the API does not change and neither
should the network protocol. Between releases, we might improve the
API which will require application programmers to update their code
to stay in sync. We can do non-API-altering changes within a release
by increasing the patch level, for bug fixing and other things.
	The symbols V_RELEASE_NUMBER and V_RELEASE_PATCH are integer
literals that hold the values for the API you have, and can be used
(and displayed) in application source code as you see fit.
