                 SCons - a software construction tool

                         Version 2.3.2


This is SCons, a tool for building software (and other files).  SCons is
implemented in Python, and its "configuration files" are actually Python
scripts, allowing you to use the full power of a real scripting language
to solve build problems.  You do not, however, need to know Python to
use SCons effectively.

See the RELEASE.txt file for notes about this specific release,
including known problems.  See the CHANGES.txt file for a list of
changes since the previous release.


LATEST VERSION
==============

Before going further, you can check that this package you have is
the latest version by checking the SCons download page at:

        http://www.scons.org/download.html


EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
======================

Running SCons requires Python version 2.4 or later.  There should be
no other dependencies or requirements to run SCons.  (There is, however,
an additional requirement to *install* SCons from this particular
package; see the next section.)

By default, SCons knows how to search for available programming tools
on various systems--see the SCons man page for details.  You may,
of course, override the default SCons choices made by appropriate
configuration of Environment construction variables.


INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
=========================

Nothing special.


INSTALLATION
============

Assuming your system satisfies the installation requirements in the
previous section, install SCons from this package simply by running the
provided Python-standard setup script as follows:

        # python setup.py install

By default, the above command will do the following:

    --  Install the version-numbered "scons-2.3.2" and "sconsign-2.3.2"
        scripts in the default system script directory (/usr/bin or
        C:\Python*\Scripts, for example).  This can be disabled by
        specifying the "--no-version-script" option on the command
        line.

    --  Install scripts named "scons" and "sconsign" scripts in the
        default system script directory (/usr/bin or C:\Python*\Scripts,
        for example).  This can be disabled by specifying the
        "--no-scons-script" option on the command line, which is useful
        if you want to install and experiment with a new version before
        making it the default on your system.

        On UNIX or Linux systems, you can have the "scons" and "sconsign"
        scripts be hard links or symbolic links to the "scons-2.3.2" and
        "sconsign-2.3.2" scripts by specifying the "--hardlink-scons"
        or "--symlink-scons" options on the command line.

    --  Install "scons-2.3.2.bat" and "scons.bat" wrapper scripts in the
        Python prefix directory on Windows (C:\Python*, for example).
        This can be disabled by specifying the "--no-install-bat" option
        on the command line.

        On UNIX or Linux systems, the "--install-bat" option may be
        specified to have "scons-2.3.2.bat" and "scons.bat" files
        installed in the default system script directory, which is useful
        if you want to install SCons in a shared file system directory
        that can be used to execute SCons from both UNIX/Linux and
        Windows systems.

    --  Install the SCons build engine (a Python module) in an
        appropriate version-numbered SCons library directory
        (/usr/lib/scons-2.3.2 or C:\Python*\scons-2.3.2, for example).
        See below for more options related to installing the build
        engine library.

    --  Install the troff-format man pages in an appropriate directory
        on UNIX or Linux systems (/usr/share/man/man1 or /usr/man/man1,
        for example).  This can be disabled by specifying the
        "--no-install-man" option on the command line.  The man pages
        can be installed on Windows systems by specifying the
        "--install-man" option on the command line.

Note that, by default, SCons does not install its build engine library
in the standard Python library directories.  If you want to be able to
use the SCons library modules (the build engine) in other Python
scripts, specify the "--standard-lib" option on the command line, as
follows:

        # python setup.py install --standard-lib

This will install the build engine in the standard Python library
directory (/usr/lib/python*/site-packages or
C:\Python*\Lib\site-packages).

Alternatively, you can have SCons install its build engine library in a
hard-coded standalone library directory, instead of the default
version-numbered directory, by specifying the "--standalone-lib" option
on the command line, as follows:

        # python setup.py install --standalone-lib

This is usually not recommended, however.

Note that, to install SCons in any of the above system directories,
you should have system installation privileges (that is, "root" or
"Administrator") when running the setup.py script.  If you don't have
system installation privileges, you can use the --prefix option to
specify an alternate installation location, such as your home directory:

        $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

This will install SCons in the appropriate locations relative to
$HOME--that is, the scons script itself $HOME/bin and the associated
library in $HOME/lib/scons, for example.


DOCUMENTATION

See the RELEASE.txt file for notes about this specific release,
including known problems.  See the CHANGES.txt file for a list of
changes since the previous release.

The scons.1 man page is included in this package, and contains a section
of small examples for getting started using SCons.
