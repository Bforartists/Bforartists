	@type frequency: int
	@ivar level: Flag to set whether to detect level or edge transition when entering a state.
					It makes a difference only in case of logic state transition (state actuator).
					A level detector will immediately generate a pulse, negative or positive
					depending on the sensor condition, as soon as the state is activated.
					A edge detector will wait for a state change before generating a pulse.
