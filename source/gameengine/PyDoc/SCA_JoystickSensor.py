class SCA_JoystickSensor(SCA_ISensor):
	"""
	This sensor detects player joystick events.
	
	Properties:
	
	@ivar axisValues: (read-only) The state of the joysticks axis as a list of values L{numAxis} long.
						each spesifying the value of an axis between -32767 and 32767 depending on how far the axis is pushed, 0 for nothing. 
						The first 2 values are used by most joysticks and gamepads for directional control. 3rd and 4th values are only on some joysticks and can be used for arbitary controls.
						left:[-32767, 0, ...], right:[32767, 0, ...], up:[0, -32767, ...], down:[0, 32767, ...]
	@type axisValues: list of ints
	
	@ivar axisSingle: (read-only) like L{axisValues} but returns a single axis value that is set by the sensor.
						Only use this for "Single Axis" type sensors otherwise it will raise an error.
	@type axisSingle: int
	
	@ivar numAxis: (read-only) The number of axes for the joystick at this index.
	@type numAxis: integer
	@ivar numButtons: (read-only) The number of buttons for the joystick at this index.
	@type numButtons: integer
	@ivar numHats: (read-only) The number of hats for the joystick at this index.
	@type numHats: integer
	@ivar connected: (read-only) True if a joystick is connected at this joysticks index.
	@type connected: boolean
	@ivar index: The joystick index to use (from 0 to 7). The first joystick is always 0.
	@type index: integer
	@ivar threshold: Axis threshold. Joystick axis motion below this threshold wont trigger an event. Use values between (0 and 32767), lower values are more sensitive.
	@type threshold: integer
	@ivar button: The button index the sensor reacts to (first button = 0). When the "All Events" toggle is set, this option has no effect.
	@type button: integer
	@ivar axis: The axis this sensor reacts to, as a list of two values [axisIndex, axisDirection]
	            axisIndex: the axis index to use when detecting axis movement, 1=primary directional control, 2=secondary directional control.
	            axisDirection: 0=right, 1=up, 2=left, 3=down
	@type axis: [integer, integer]
	@ivar hat: The hat the sensor reacts to, as a list of two values: [hatIndex, hatDirection]
	            hatIndex: the hat index to use when detecting hat movement, 1=primary hat, 2=secondary hat.
	            hatDirection: 0-11
	@type hat: [integer, integer]
