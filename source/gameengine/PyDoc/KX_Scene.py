class KX_Scene:
	"""
	Scene.
	
	The activity culling stuff is supposed to disable logic bricks when their owner gets too far
	from the active camera.  It was taken from some code lurking at the back of KX_Scene - who knows 
	what it does!
	
	Example::
		import GameLogic
		
		# get the scene
		scene = GameLogic.getCurrentScene()
		
		# print all the objects in the scene
		for obj in scene.objects:
			print obj.name
		
		# get an object named 'Cube'
		obj = scene.objects["OBCube"]
		
		# get the first object in the scene.
		obj = scene.objects[0]
	
	Example::
		# Get the depth of an object in the camera view.
		import GameLogic
		
		obj = GameLogic.getCurrentController().getOwner()
		cam = GameLogic.getCurrentScene().active_camera
		
		# Depth is negative and decreasing further from the camera
		depth = obj.position[0]*cam.world_to_camera[2][0] + obj.position[1]*cam.world_to_camera[2][1] + obj.position[2]*cam.world_to_camera[2][2] + cam.world_to_camera[2][3]
