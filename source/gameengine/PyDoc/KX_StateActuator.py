	"""
	State actuator changes the state mask of parent object.
	
	Property:
	
	@ivar operation: type of bit operation to be applied on object state mask.
					You can use one of the following constant:
						- KX_STATE_OP_CPY (0) : Copy state mask
						- KX_STATE_OP_SET (1) : Add bits to state mask
						- KX_STATE_OP_CLR (2) : Substract bits to state mask
						- KX_STATE_OP_NEG (3) : Invert bits to state mask
	@type operation: integer
	
	@ivar mask: value that defines the bits that will be modified by the operation.
				The bits that are 1 in the mask will be updated in the object state,
				the bits that are 0 are will be left unmodified expect for the Copy operation
				which copies the mask to the object state
	@type mask: integer
	"""
