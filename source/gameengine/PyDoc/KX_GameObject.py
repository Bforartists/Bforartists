			# shoot along the axis gun-gunAim (gunAim should be collision-free)

			if ob:
				# hit something

		Notes:				
		The ray ignores the object on which the method is called.
		It is casted from/to object center or explicit [x,y,z] points.
		
		The face paremeter determines the orientation of the normal:: 
		  0 => hit normal is always oriented towards the ray origin (as if you casted the ray from outside)
		  1 => hit normal is the real face normal (only for mesh object, otherwise face has no effect)
		  
		The ray has X-Ray capability if xray parameter is 1, otherwise the first object hit (other than self object) stops the ray.
		The prop and xray parameters interact as follow::
		    prop off, xray off: return closest hit or no hit if there is no object on the full extend of the ray.
		    prop off, xray on : idem.
		    prop on,  xray off: return closest hit if it matches prop, no hit otherwise.
		    prop on,  xray on : return closest hit matching prop or no hit if there is no object matching prop on the full extend of the ray.
		The L{KX_PolyProxy} 4th element of the return tuple when poly=1 allows to retrieve information on the polygon hit by the ray.
		If there is no hit or the hit object is not a static mesh, None is returned as 4th element. 
		
		The ray ignores collision-free objects and faces that dont have the collision flag enabled, you can however use ghost objects.

		@type objto: L{KX_GameObject} or 3-tuple
