	"""	
	Create a point constraint between two objects, an edge constraint between two objects, or a vehicle constraint on an object.
	
	You only have to input the needed parammeters depending on the type of constraint you are trying to create.
	

	B{Point Constraint} ::
	
		While creating a point constraint, the "pointPos" values define where you want the pivot point to be located.
		If you are creating a point constraint be sure to assing the integer "1" as the constraintType value.
	
		Parameters to use:
		obj_PhysicsID, root_PhysicsID, constraintType, pointPos_x, pointPos_y, pointPos_z
	
	B{Edge Constraint} ::
		
		While creating an edge constraint, the "edgePos" values define where you want the center of the edge constraint to be.
		Also, the "edgeAngle" values define in which direction you want the edge constraint to point (As a 3 dimensions vector).
		If you want to create an edge constraint be sure to assing the integer "2" as the constraintType value.

		Parameters to use:
		obj_PhysicsID, root_PhysicsID, constraintType, edgePos_x, edgePos_y, edgePos_z, edgeAngle_x, edgeAngle_y, edgeAngle_z}		
	
	B{Vehicle Constraint} ::
		
		While creating a point constraint, the "pointPos" values define where you want the pivot point to be located.
		If you want to create an edge constraint be sure to assing the integer "0" as the constraintType value.

		Parameters to use :
		obj_PhysicsID, root_PhysicsID, constraintType
