# Blender.Lattice module and the Lattice PyType object

"""
The Blender.Lattice submodule.

Lattice Object
==============

This module provides access to B{Lattice} object in Blender.

Example::
  import Blender
  from Blender import Lattice
  from Blender.Lattice import *
  from Blender import Object
  from Blender import Scene

  myOb = Object.New('Lattice')
  myLat = Lattice.New()
  myLat.setPartitions(5,5,5)
  myLat.setKeyTypes(LINEAR, CARDINAL, BSPLINE)
  myLat.setMode(OUTSIDE)

  for y in range(125):
    vec = myLat.getPoint(y)
    co1 = vec[0] + vec[0] / 5
    co2 = vec[1] - vec[2] * 0.3
    co3 = vec[2] * 3
    myLat.setPoint(y,[co1,co2,co3])

  myOb.link(myLat)
  mySphere = Object.Get('Sphere')
  myOb.makeParent([mySphere])

  myLat.applyDeform()

  sc = Scene.getCurrent()
  sc.link(myOb)
  Blender.Redraw()

    Applies the current Lattice deformation to any child objects that have this

    @note: simply parenting to a Lattice and redrawing the screen is enough to
      get the deformation done, this applyDeform method is useful when the
      script won't call a redraw, like in command line background (GUI-less)
      mode.
    @note: by default, this method doesn't apply deformations to meshes.  This
      is because unlike other kinds of objects, meshes store lattice
      deformation directly in their vertices and calling this applyDeform
      method will apply the deformation a second time, giving double
      deformation, which can be a feature (set force = True if you want it) or
      much probably an undesired effect.
