The Blender.Effect submodule

B{new}: now L{Get}('objname') (without specifying second paramenter: 'position') returns a list of all effects linked to object "objname".

Effect
======

INTRODUCTION

The Effect module allows you to access all the data of particle effects.
An effect can modify a mesh object using particles, where vertex of
the mesh emits particles, which can themselves emit new particles.

In the Blender internals, the effect object is just a placeholder for
the particle effect.  Prior to v2.39 build and wave effects were also
supported by Blender, and the Python API supported all three types of
effects.  They were removed in v2.39 when the build and wave modifiers
were implemented.


Example::
  import Blender
	listffects = Blender.Effect.Get()
	print listeffects
	eff = listeffects[0]
	#we suppose the first effect is a build effect
	print eff.getLen()
	eff.setLen(500)	

@type Flags: read-only dictionary
@var Flags: The particle effect flags.  Values can be ORed.
  - SELECTED: The particle effect is selected in the UI. (Read-only)
  - BSPLINE: Use a B-spline formula for particle interpolation
  - STATIC: Make static particles
  - ANIMATED: Recalculate static particles for each rendered frame
  - VERTS: Emit particles from vertices
  - FACES: Emit particles from faces
  - EVENDIST: Use even distribution based on face area (requires FACES)
  - TRUERAND: Use true random distribution based on face area (requires FACES)
  - UNBORN: Make particles appear before they are emitted
  - DIED: Make particles appear after they have died
  - EMESH: Render emitter mesh

@type SpeedTypes: read-only dictionary
@var SpeedTypes: The available settings for selecting particle speed vectors.
Only one setting is active at a time.
  - INTENSITY: Use texture intensity
  - RGB: Use RGB values
  - GRADIENT: Use texture gradient
