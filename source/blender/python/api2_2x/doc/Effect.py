# Blender.Effect module and the Effect PyType effect

"""
The Blender.Effect submodule

INTRODUCTION

The module effect allows you to access all the data of an effect.
An effect can modify an object (typically a mesh) in three different ways.

a) the build effect : makes the mesh appear progressivly.

b) the wave effect : waves appear on the mesh (which should be fine-grained)

c) the particle effect : every vertex of the mesh emits particles, which can themselves emit new particles. This effect is the most parametrizable.

In the blender internals, the effect object is just a placeholder for the "real"
effect, which can be a wave, particle or build effect. The python API follows
this structure : the Effect module grants access to (the few) data which
are shared between all effects. It has three submodules : Wave, Build, Particle
, which grant r/w access to the real parameters of these effects.

Example::
  import Blender
"""

def New (type):
  """
  Creates a new Effect.
  @type type: string
  @param type: Effect type. Can be "wave", "particle" or "build"
  @rtype: Blender Effect
  @return: The created Effect.
  """

def Get (objname,position):
  """
