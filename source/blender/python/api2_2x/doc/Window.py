# Blender.Window module and the Window PyType object

"""
The Blender.Window submodule.

B{New}: renamed ViewLayer to L{ViewLayers} (actually added an alias, so both
forms will work).

Window
======

This module provides access to B{Window} functions in Blender.

Example:
--------

FileSelector::

  import Blender
  from Blender import Window
  #
  def my_callback(filename):                # callback for the FileSelector
    print "You chose the file:", filename   # do something with the chosen file
  #
  Window.FileSelector (my_callback, "Choose one!")

Example:
--------

DrawProgressBar::

  import Blender
  from Blender.Window import DrawProgressBar
  #
  # substitute the bogus_*() function calls for your own, of course.
  #
  DrawProgressBar (0.0, "Importing data ...")
  bogus_importData()
  DrawProgressBar (0.3, "Building something")
  bogus_build()
  DrawProgressBar (0.8, "Updating Blender")
  bogus_update()
  DrawProgressBar (1.0, "Finished") 
  #
  # another example:
  #
  number = 1
  while number < 20:
    file = filename + "00%d" % number
    DrawProgressBar (number / 20.0, "Loading texture: %s" % file)
    Blender.Image.Load(file)
    number += 1

  DrawProgressBar (1.0, "Finished loading")


@type Types: readonly dictionary
@var Types: The available Window Types.

    - IPO
    - NLA
    - OOPS
    - SCRIPT
    - SEQ

@type Qual: readonly dictionary
@var Qual: Qualifier keys (shift, control, alt) bitmasks.
    - LALT: left ALT key
    - RALT: right ALT key
    - ALT: any ALT key, ...
    - LCTRL
    - RCTRL
    - CTRL

@type MButs: readonly dictionary
@var MButs: Mouse buttons.
    - L: left mouse button
    - M: middle mouse button
    - R: right mouse button

@warn: The event system in Blender needs a rewrite, though we don't know when that will happen.  Until then, event related functions here (L{QAdd}, L{QRead},
L{QHandle}, etc.) can be used, but they are actually experimental and can be
substituted for a better method when the rewrite happens.  In other words, use
them at your own risk, because though they should work well and allow many
interesting and powerful possibilities, they can be deprecated in some future
version of Blender / Blender Python.

def FileSelector (callback, title = 'SELECT FILE', filename = '<default>'):

  Open the file selector window in Blender.  After the user selects a filename,

  @type filename: string
  @param filename: A filename.  This defaults to Blender.Get('filename').
  @warn: script links are not allowed to call the File / Image Selectors.  This
     is because script links global dictionaries are removed when they finish
     execution and the File Selector needs the passed callback to stay around.
     An alternative is calling the File Selector from another script (see
     L{Blender.Run}).

  @warn: this is an important function. NMesh operates on normal Blender
      meshes, not edit mode ones.  If a script changes an active mesh while in
      edit mode, when the user leaves the mode the changes will be lost,
