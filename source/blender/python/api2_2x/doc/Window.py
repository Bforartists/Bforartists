# Blender.Window module and the Window PyType object

"""
The Blender.Window submodule.

Window
======

This module provides access to B{Window} functions in Blender.

Example:
--------

FileSelector::

  import Blender
  from Blender import Window
  #
  def my_callback(filename):                # callback for the FileSelector
    print "You chose the file:", filename   # do something with the chosen file
  #
  Window.FileSelector (my_callback, "Choose one!")

Example:
--------

DrawProgressBar::

  import Blender
  from Blender.Window import DrawProgressBar
  #
  # substitute the bogus_*() function calls for your own, of course.
  #
  DrawProgressBar (0.0, "Importing data ...")
  bogus_importData()
  DrawProgressBar (0.3, "Building something")
  bogus_build()
  DrawProgressBar (0.8, "Updating Blender")
  bogus_update()
  DrawProgressBar (1.0, "Finished") 
  #
  # another example:
  #
  number = 1
  while number < 20:
    file = filename + "00%d" % number
    DrawProgressBar (number / 20.0, "Loading texture: %s" % file)
    Blender.Image.Load(file)
    number += 1

  DrawProgressBar (1.0, "Finished loading")

def FileSelector (callback, title = 'SELECT FILE'):
