# Blender.Object.Pose module

"""
The Blender.Object.Pose submodule.

Pose
====

This module provides access to B{Pose} objects in Blender.  This Pose is the 
current object-level (as opposed to armature-data level) transformation.

Example::


@var ROT: 
@type ROT: Constant
@var LOC: 
@type LOC: Constant
@var SIZE: 
@type SIZE: Constant
