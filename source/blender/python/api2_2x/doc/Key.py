# Blender.Key module and the Key and KeyBlock PyType objects

"""
The Blender.Key submodule.

This module provides access to B{Key} objects in Blender.

@type Types: readonly dictionary
@var Types: The type of a key, indicating the type of data in the
data blocks.
    - MESH - the key is a Mesh key; data blocks contain
    L{NMesh.NMVert} vertices.
    - CURVE - the key is a Curve key; data blocks contain
    L{Ipo.BezTriple} points.
    - LATTICE - the key is a Lattice key; data blocks contain
    BPoints, each point represented as a list of 4 floating point numbers.
