# Blender.Key module and the Key and KeyBlock PyType objects

"""
The Blender.Key submodule.

This module provides access to B{Key} objects in Blender.

@type Types: readonly dictionary
@var Types: The type of a key owner, indicating the type of data in the
data blocks.
	- MESH - the key is a Mesh key; data blocks contain
	L{NMVert<NMesh.NMVert>} vertices.
	- CURVE - the key is a Curve key; data blocks contains either
	L{BezTriples<BezTriple.BezTriple>} or points (represented by a list of
	3 floating point numbers).
	- LATTICE - the key is a Lattice key; data blocks contain
	BPoints, each point represented by a list of 3 floating point numbers.

def Get(name = None):
	"""
	Get the named Key object from Blender. If the name is omitted, it
	will retrieve a list of all keys in Blender.
	@type name: string
	@param name: the name of the requested key
	@return: If name was given, return that Key object (or None if not
	found). If a name was not given, return a list of every Key object
	in Blender.

	The Key object
	==============
	An object with keyframes (L{Lattice}, L{NMesh} or
	L{Curve}) will contain a Key object representing the
	keyframe data.
	
	@ivar ipo:  Key Ipo.  Contains the Ipo if one is assigned to the
	object, B{None} otherwise.  Setting to B{None} clears the current Ipo.
	@type ipo:  Blender Ipo
	@ivar value: The value of the key. Read-only.
	@type value: float
	@ivar type: An integer from the L{Types} dictionary
	representing the Key type.  Read-only.
	@type type: int
	@ivar blocks: A list of KeyBlocks for the key.  Read-only.
	@type blocks: Blender KeyBlock.
	@ivar relative: Indicates whether the key is relative(=True) or normal.

	The KeyBlock object
	===================
	Each Key object has a list of KeyBlocks attached, each KeyBlock

	def getData():
		"""
		Get the data of a KeyBlock, as a list of data items. Each item
		will have a different data type depending on the type of this
		Key.
			- Mesh keys have a list of L{NMVert<NMesh.NMVert>} objects in the data
			block.
			- Lattice keys have a list of BPoints in the data block. These
			don't have corresponding Python objects yet, so each BPoint is
			represented using a list of three floating-point numbers (the
			coordinate for each lattice vertex).
			- Curve keys return either a list of L{BezTriple<BezTriple.BezTriple>}
			objects in the data if the curve is a Bezier curve, otherwise it 
			returns lists of three floats for each NURB or poly coordinate.
