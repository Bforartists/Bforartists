# Blender.NMesh module and the NMesh PyType object

Mesh Data
=========

This module provides access to B{Mesh Data} objects in Blender.

Example::

  import Blender
  from Blender import NMesh, Material
  #
  me = NMesh.GetRaw("Plane")       # get the mesh data called "Plane"

  if not me.materials:             # if there are no materials ...
    newmat = Material.New()        # create one ...
    me.materials.append(newmat)    # and append it to the mesh's list of mats

  print me.materials               # print the list of materials
  mat = me.materials[0]            # grab the first material in the list
  mat.R = 1.0                      # redefine its red component
  for v in me.verts:               # loop the list of vertices
    v.co[0] *= 2.5                 # multiply the coordinates
    v.co[1] *= 5.0
    v.co[2] *= 2.5
  me.update()                      # update the real mesh in Blender

     second, for each face it belongs to, a vertex can have different uv
     coordinates.  This makes the per face option more flexible, since two
