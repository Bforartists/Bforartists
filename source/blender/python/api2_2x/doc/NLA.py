# Blender.Armature.NLA module and the Action PyType object

"""
The Blender.Armature.NLA submodule.

NLA
===

This module provides access to B{Action} objects in Blender.  Actions are a
series of keyframes/Ipo curves that define the movement of a bone. 
Actions are linked to objects of type armature.

@type Flags: readonly dictionary
@var Flags: Constant dict used by the L{ActionStrip.flag} attribute.
It is a bitmask and settings are ORed together.
	- SELECT: action strip is selected in NLA window
	- STRIDE_PATH: play action based on path position and stride.
	- HOLD: continue displaying the last frame past the end of the strip
	- ACTIVE: action strip is active in NLA window
	- LOCK_ACTION: action start/end are automatically mapped to strip duration
	- MUTE: action strip does not contribute to the NLA solution

@type StrideAxes: readonly dictionary
@var StrideAxes: Constant dict used by the L{ActionStrip.strideAxis} attribute.
Values are STRIDEAXIS_X, STRIDEAXIS_Y, and STRIDEAXIS_Z.

@type Modes: readonly dictionary
@var Modes: Constant dict used by the L{ActionStrip.mode} attribute.
Currently the only value is MODE_ADD.
