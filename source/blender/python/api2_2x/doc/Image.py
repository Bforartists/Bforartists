# Blender.Image module and the Image PyType object

"""
The Blender.Image submodule.

Image
=====

B{New}: L{Image.setFilename}.

This module provides access to B{Image} objects in Blender.

Example::
  import Blender
  from Blender import Image
  #
  image = Image.Load("/path/to/my/image.png")    # load an image file
  print "Image from", image.getFilename(),
  print "loaded to obj", image.getName())
  image.setXRep(4)                               # set x tiling factor
  image.setYRep(2)                               # set y tiling factor
  print "All Images available now:", Image.Get()
