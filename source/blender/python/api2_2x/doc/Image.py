# Blender.Image module and the Image PyType object

"""
The Blender.Image submodule.

Image

	#
	image = Image.Load("/path/to/my/image.png")    # load an image file
	print "Image from", image.getFilename(),
	print "loaded to obj", image.getName())
	image.setXRep(4)                               # set x tiling factor
	image.setYRep(2)                               # set y tiling factor
