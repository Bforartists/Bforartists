# Blender.Armature module and the Armature PyType object

"""
The Blender.Armature submodule.

Armature
========

This module provides access to B{Armature} objects in Blender.  These are
"skeletons", used to deform and animate other objects -- meshes, for
example.

Example::
  import Blender
  from Blender import Armature as A
  from Blender.Mathutils import *
  #
  arms = A.Get()
  for arm in arms.values():
    arm.drawType = A.STICK #set the draw type
    arm.makeEditable() #enter editmode

    #generating new editbone
    eb = A.Editbone()
    eb.roll = 10
    eb.parent = arm.bones['Bone.003']
    eb.head = Vector(1,1,1)
    eb.tail = Vector(0,0,1)
    eb.options = [A.HINGE, A.CONNECTED]

    #add the bone
    arm.bones['myNewBone'] = eb
  
    #delete an old bone
    del arm.bones['Bone.002']

    arm.update()  #save changes

    for bone in arm.bones.values():
      #print bone.matrix['ARMATURESPACE']
      print bone.parent, bone.name
      print bone.children, bone.name
      print bone.options, bone.name
