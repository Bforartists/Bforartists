# Blender.Mesh module and the Mesh PyType object

"""
The Blender.Mesh submodule.

B{New}:
 - L{transform()<Mesh.transform>}: apply transform matrix to mesh vertices
 - L{getFromObject()<Mesh.getFromObject>}: get mesh data from other
   geometry objects
 - L{findEdges()<Mesh.findEdges>}: determine if and where edges exist in the
   mesh's edge list
 - delete methods for L{verts<MVertSeq.delete>}, L{edges<MEdgeSeq.delete>}
   and L{faces<MFaceSeq.delete>}
 - new experimental mesh tools:
   L{fill()<Mesh.Mesh.fill>},
   L{flipNormals()<Mesh.Mesh.flipNormals>},
   L{recalcNormals()<Mesh.Mesh.recalcNormals>},
   L{remDoubles()<Mesh.Mesh.remDoubles>},
   L{smooth()<Mesh.Mesh.smooth>},
   L{subdivide()<Mesh.Mesh.subdivide>} and
   L{toSphere()<Mesh.Mesh.toSphere>}
 - and if you're never used Mesh before, everything!

Mesh Data
=========

This module provides access to B{Mesh Data} objects in Blender.  It differs
from the NMesh module by allowing direct access to the actual Blender data, 
so that changes are done immediately without need to update or put the data
back into the original mesh.  The result is faster operations with less memory
usage.

Example::

  import Blender
  from Blender import Mesh, Material, Window

  editmode = Window.EditMode()    # are we in edit mode?  If so ...
  if editmode: Window.EditMode(0) # leave edit mode before getting the mesh

  me = Mesh.Get("Plane")          # get the mesh data called "Plane"

  if not me.materials:             # if there are no materials ...
    newmat = Material.New()        # create one ...
    me.materials=[newmat]          # and set the mesh's list of mats

  print me.materials               # print the list of materials
  mat = me.materials[0]            # grab the first material in the list
  mat.R = 1.0                      # redefine its red component
  for v in me.verts:               # loop the list of vertices
    v.co[0] *= 2.5                 # multiply the coordinates
    v.co[1] *= 5.0
    v.co[2] *= 2.5

  if editmode: Window.EditMode(1)  # optional, just being nice

  @type sel: int
  @warn:  There are two kinds of UV texture coordinates in Blender: per vertex
     ("sticky") and per face vertex (UV in L{MFace}).  In the first, there's
     only one UV pair of coordinates for each vertex in the mesh.  In the
     second, for each face it belongs to, a vertex can have different UV
     coordinates.  This makes the per face option more flexible, since two
     adjacent faces won't have to be mapped to a continuous region in an image:
     each face can be independently mapped to any part of its texture.

    @note: PVert-type objects are designed to be used for creating and
    modifying a mesh's vertex list, but since they do not "wrap" any Blender
    data there are some differences.  The B{index} and B{uvco} attributes 
    are not defined for PVerts, and the B{no} attribute contains valid
    data only if the PVert was created from an MVert (using a slice
    operation on the mesh's vertex list.)  PVerts also cannot be used as an

class MVertSeq:
  """
  The MVertSeq object
  ===================
    This object provides sequence and iterator access to the mesh's vertices.
    Access and assignment of single items and slices are also supported.
    When a single item in the vertex list is accessed, the operator[] returns
    a MVert object which "wraps" the actual vertex in the mesh; changing any
    of the vertex's attributes will immediately change the data in the mesh.
    When a slice of the vertex list is accessed, however, the operator[]
    returns a list of PVert objects which are copies of the mesh's vertex
    data.  Changes to these objects have no effect on the mesh; they must be
    assigned back to the mesh's vertex list.

    Slice assignments cannot change the vertex list size.  The size of the
    list being assigned must be the same as the specified slice; otherwise an
    exception is thrown.

       not work with PVerts) or a sequence (list or tuple) containing two or
       more tuples.

    @return: if an edge is found, its index is returned; otherwise None is
    returned.  If a sequence of edges is passed, a list is returned.
