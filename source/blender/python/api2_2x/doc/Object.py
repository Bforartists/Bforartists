# Blender.Object module and the Object PyType object

"""
The Blender.Object submodule

B{New}:
  - Addition of attributes for particle deflection, softbodies, and
    rigidbodies.
  - Objects now increment the Blender user count when they are created and
    decremented it when they are destroyed.  This means Python scripts can
    keep the object "alive" if it is deleted in the Blender GUI.
  - L{Object.getData} now accepts two optional bool keyword argument to
      define (1) if the user wants the data object or just its name
      and (2) if a mesh object should use NMesh or Mesh.
  - L{Object.clearScriptLinks} accepts a parameter now.
  - Object attributes: renamed Layer to L{Layers<Object.Object.Layers>} and
    added the easier L{layers<Object.Object.layers>}.  The old form "Layer"
    will continue to work.


Object

This module provides access to the B{Objects} in Blender.

  ob.link (cam)                         # link camera data with the object
  scene.link (ob)                       # link the object into the scene
  ob.setLocation (0.0, -5.0, 1.0)       # position the object in the scene

  object is not linked to a scene, it will be deleted when the Python
  object is deallocated.  This is because Blender does not allow objects

    When dealing with properties and functions such as LocX/RotY/getLocation(), getSize() and getEuler(),
    keep in mind that these transformation properties are relative to the object's parent (if any).

        L{layers<layers>}).  This value is a bitmask with at 
        least one position set for the 20 possible layers starting from the low
        order bit.  The easiest way to deal with these values in in hexadecimal
        notation.
        Example::
          ob.Layer = 0x04 # sets layer 3 ( bit pattern 0100 )
        After setting the Layer value, call Blender.Redraw( -1 ) to update

        layer.  Setting is done by passing a list of ints or an empty list for
        no layers.
        Example::
          ob.layers = []  # object won't be visible

        Example::
            object.colbits = (1<<0) + (1<<5) # use mesh materials 0 (1<<0) and 5 (1<<5)
                                  # use object materials for all others

        DupGroup to make this object an instance of that group.
        This does not enable or disable the DupliGroup option, for that use

        The attribute returns None when this object does not have a dupliGroup, 
        and setting the attrbute to None deletes the object from the group.
    @type DupGroup: Group or None
    @ivar DupObjects: The Dupli object instances.  Read-only.
