"""
The bpy module.

bpy
===

	ATTENTION:  This module is EXPERIMENTAL.
	Features documented here are subject to change.

	The bpy module is intended as a replacement for the Blender module.
	It will eventually provide the same features and functionality.

	This module uses a different model for the way data is accessed, added and removed.  The various types such as groups, meshes, etc., are unchanged.

	At the moment it provides an alternative way to access data from python.

	Submodules:
	-----------
		- L{data<Bpy_data>}
		- L{libraries<LibData.Libraries>}
		- L{config<Bpy_config>}
