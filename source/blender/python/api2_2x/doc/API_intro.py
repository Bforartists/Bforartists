Introduction:
=============

	This reference documents the Blender Python API, a growing collection of
	Python modules (libraries) that give access to part of the program's internal
	data and functions.
	
	Through scripting Blender can be extended in real-time via
	U{Python <www.python.org>}, an impressive high level, multi-paradigm, open
	source language.  Newcomers are recommended to start with the tutorial that
	comes with it.

	This opens many interesting possibilities, ranging from automating repetitive
	tasks to adding new functionality to the program: procedural models,
	importers and exporters, even complex applications and so on.  Blender itself
	comes with some scripts, but many others can be found in the Scripts & Plugins
	sections and forum posts at the Blender-related sites listed below.

Scripting and Blender:
======================

These are the basic ways to execute scripts in Blender:

	1. They can be loaded or typed as text files in the Text Editor window, then
	executed with ALT+P.
	2. Via command line: C{blender -P <scriptname>} will start Blender and execute
	the given script.  <scriptname> can be a filename in the user's file system or
	the name of a text saved in a .blend Blender file:
	'blender myfile.blend -P textname'.
	3. Via command line in I{background mode}: use the '-b' flag (the order is
	important): C{blender -b <blendfile> -P <scriptname>}.  <blendfile> can be any
	.blend file, including the default .B.blend that is in Blender's home directory
	L{Blender.Get}('homedir'). In this mode no window will be opened and the
	program will leave as soon as the script finishes execution.
	4. Properly registered scripts can be selected directly from the program's
	menus.
	5. Scriptlinks: these are also loaded or typed in the Text Editor window and
	can be linked to objects, materials or scenes using the Scriptlink buttons
	tab.  Script links get executed automatically when their events (ONLOAD,
	REDRAW, FRAMECHANGED) are triggered.  Normal scripts can create (L{Text}) and
	link other scripts to objects and events, see L{Object.Object.addScriptLink},
	for example.
	6. A script can call another script (that will run in its own context, with
	its own global dictionary) with the L{Blender.Run} module function.


Interaction with users:
-----------------------

	Scripts can:
		- simply run and exit;
		- pop messages, menus and small number and text input boxes;
		- draw graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with OpenGL calls and native
			program buttons, which stay there accepting user input like any other
			Blender window until the user closes them;
		- attach themselves to a space's event or drawing code (aka space handlers,
			L{check here<API_related>});
		- make changes to the 3D View (set visible layer(s), view point, etc);
		- grab the main input event queue and process (or pass to Blender) selected
			keyboard, mouse, redraw events -- not considered good practice, but still
			available for private use;
		- tell Blender to execute other scripts (see L{Blender.Run}());
		- use external Python libraries, if available.

	You can read the documentation for the L{Window}, L{Draw} and L{BGL} modules
	for more information and also check the Python site for external modules that
	might be useful to you.  Note though that any imported module will become a
	requirement of your script, since Blender itself does not bundle external
	modules.

Command line mode:
------------------

	Python was embedded in Blender, so to access BPython modules you need to
	run scripts from the program itself: you can't import the Blender module
	into an external Python interpreter.

	On the other hand, for many tasks it's possible to control Blender via
	some automated process using scripts.  Interested readers should learn about
	features like "OnLoad" script links, the "-b <blendfile>" (background mode)
	and "-P <script>" (run script) command line options and API calls like
	L{Blender.Save}, L{Blender.Load}, L{Blender.Quit} and the L{Library} and
	L{Render} modules. 

	Note that command line scripts are run before Blender initializes its windows
	(and in '-b' mode no window will be initialized), so many functions that get
	or set window related attributes (like most in L{Window}) don't work here.  If
	you need those, use an ONLOAD script link (see L{Scene.Scene.addScriptLink})
	instead -- it's also possible to use a command line script to write or set an
	ONLOAD script link.  Check the L{Blender.mode} module var to know if Blender
	is being executed in "background" or "interactive" mode.

Demo mode:
----------

	Blender has a demo mode, where once started it can work without user
	intervention, "showing itself off".  Demos can render stills and animations,
	play rendered or real-time animations, calculate radiosity simulations and
	do many other nifty things.  If you want to turn a .blend file into a demo,
	write a script to run the show and link it as a scene "OnLoad" scriptlink.
	The demo will then be played automatically whenever this .blend file is
	opened, B{unless Blender was started with the "-y" parameter}.

The Game Engine API:
--------------------

	Blender has a game engine for users to create and play 3d games.  This
	engine lets programmers add scripts to improve game AI, control, etc, making
	more complex interaction and tricks possible.  The game engine API is
	separate from the Blender Python API this document references and you can
	find its own ref doc in the doc section of the main sites below.

Blender Data Structures:
------------------------

	Programs manipulate data structures.  Blender python scripts are no exception.
	Blender uses an Object Oriented architecture.  The BPython interface tries to
	present Blender objects and their attributes in the same way you see them
	through the User Interface (the GUI).  One key to BPython programming is
	understanding the information presented in Blender's OOPS window where Blender
	objects and their relationships are displayed.

	Each Blender graphic element (Mesh, Lamp, Curve, etc.) is composed from two
	parts: an Object and ObData. The Object holds information about the position,
	rotation and size of the element.  This is information that all elements have
	in common.  The ObData holds information specific to that particular type of
	element.  

	Each Object has a link to its associated ObData.  A single ObData may be
	shared by many Objects.  A graphic element also has a link to a list of
	Materials.  By default, this list is associated with the ObData.

	All Blender objects have a unique name.  However, the name is qualified by the
	type of the object.  This means you can have a Lamp Object called Lamp.001
	(OB:Lamp.001) and a Lamp ObData called Lamp.001 (LA:Lamp.001).

	For a more in-depth look at Blender internals, and some understanding of why
	Blender works the way it does, see the U{Blender Architecture document
	<http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Blender_Architecture.336.0.html>}.


A note to newbie script writers:
--------------------------------

	Interpreted languages are known to be much slower than compiled code, but for
	many applications the difference is negligible or acceptable.  Also, with
	profiling (or even simple direct timing with L{Blender.sys.time<Sys.time>}) to
	identify slow areas and well thought optimizations, the speed can be
	I{considerably} improved in many cases.  Try some of the best BPython scripts
	to get an idea of what can be done, you may be surprised.

	version yourself: install epydoc, grab all files in the
	source/blender/python/api2_2x/doc/ folder of Blender's CVS and use the
	epy_docgen.sh script also found there to generate the html docs.
	Naturally you will also need a recent Blender binary to try the new
	features.  If you prefer not to compile it yourself, there is a testing
	builds forum at U{blender.org<http://www.blender.org>}.
