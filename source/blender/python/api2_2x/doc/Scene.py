# Blender.Scene module and the Scene PyType object

"""
The Blender.Scene submodule.

B{New}:
  - L{Scene.clearScriptLinks<Scene.Scene.clearScriptLinks>} accepts a parameter now.
  - acess methods L{Scene.getLayers<Scene.Scene.getLayers>}, L{Scene.setLayers<Scene.Scene.setLayers>} via lists to complement the layers and
    Layers Scene attributes which use bitmasks. 
  - L{Scene.getActiveObject<Scene.Scene.getActiveObject>} method.

Scene
=====

This module provides access to B{Scenes} in Blender.

Example::
  import Blender
  from Blender import Scene, Object, Camera
  #
  camdata = Camera.New('persp')           # create new camera data
  camdata.name = 'newCam'
  camdata.lens = 16.0
  scene = Scene.New('NewScene')           # create a new scene
  scene.objects.new(camdata,'Camera')     # add a new object to the scene with newly-created data
  scene.makeCurrent()                     # make this the current scene

@warn: B{scene.objects.new} is the preferred way to add new objects to a scene.
    The older way is to create an object with B{Object.New()}, link the
    data to the new object, then link the object to the scene.  This way is
    not recommended since a forgotten step or run-time error in the script can 
    cause bad things to be done to Blender's database.

    If you use this older method, it's recommended to always perform the
    operations in this order.  This is because if
    there is no object data linked to an object B{ob}, B{scene.link(ob)} will
    automatically create the missing data.  This is OK on its own, but I{if
    after that} object B{ob} is linked to obdata, the automatically created one
    will be discarded -- as expected -- but will stay in Blender's memory
    space until the program is exited, since Blender doesn't really get rid of
    most kinds of data.  So first linking ObData to object, then object to
    scene is a tiny tiny bit faster than the other way around and also saves
    some realtime memory (if many objects are created from scripts, the
    savings become important).

  The Scene object
  ================
   This object gives access to Scene data in Blender.
  @ivar properties: Returns an L{IDGroup<IDProp.IDGroup>} reference to this 
  scene's ID Properties.
  @type properties: L{IDGroup<IDProp.IDGroup>}
  @type name: string
  @ivar name: The Scene name.
  @type Layers: integer (bitmask)
  @ivar Layers: The Scene layers (check also the easier to use
        L{layers}).  This value is a bitmask with at least
        one position set for the 20 possible layers starting from the low order
        bit.  The easiest way to deal with these values in in hexadecimal 
        notation.
        Example::
          scene.Layers = 0x04 # sets layer 3 ( bit pattern 0100 )
          scene.Layers |= 0x01
          print scene.Layers # will print: 5 ( meaning bit pattern 0101)
        After setting the Layers value, the interface (at least the 3d View and
        the Buttons window) needs to be redrawn to show the changes.
  @type layers: list of integers
  @ivar layers: The Scene layers (check also L{Layers}).
        This attribute accepts and returns a list of integer values in the
        range [1, 20].
        Example::
          scene.layers = [3] # set layer 3
          scene.layers = scene.layers.append(1)
          print scene.layers # will print: [1, 3]
  @type objects: sequence of objects
  @ivar objects: The scene's objects. The sequence supports the methods .link(ob), .unlink(ob), and .new(obdata), and can be iterated over.
