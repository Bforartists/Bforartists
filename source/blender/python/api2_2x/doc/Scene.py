# Blender.Scene module and the Scene PyType object

"""
The Blender.Scene submodule.

B{New}:
  - L{Scene.clearScriptLinks} accepts a parameter now.
  - L{Scene.getLayers}, L{Scene.setLayers} and the L{layers<Scene.layers>} and
    L{Layers<Scene.Layers>} Scene attributes. 
  - L{Scene.getActiveObject} method.

Scene
=====

This module provides access to B{Scenes} in Blender.

Example::
  import Blender
  from Blender import Scene, Object, Camera
  #
  camdata = Camera.New('ortho')           # create new camera data
  camdata.setName('newCam')
  camdata.setLens(16.0)
  scene = Scene.New('NewScene')           # create a new scene
  camobj = Object.New('Camera')           # create a new camera object
  camobj.link(camdata)                    # (*) link data to object first
  scene.link(camobj)                      # and then link object to scene
  scene.makeCurrent()                     # make this the current scene

@warn: as done in the example (*), it's recommended to first link object data to
    objects and only after that link objects to scene.  This is because if
    there is no object data linked to an object ob, scene.link(ob) will
    automatically create the missing data.  This is ok on its own, but I{if
    after that} this object is linked to obdata, the automatically created one
    will be discarded -- as expected -- but will stay in Blender's memory
    space until the program is exited, since Blender doesn't really get rid of
    most kinds of data.  So first linking obdata to object, then object to
    scene is a tiny tiny bit faster than the other way around and also saves
    some realtime memory (if many objects are created from scripts, the
    savings become important).

  The Scene object
  ================
    This object gives access to Scene data in Blender.
  @type name: string
  @cvar name: The Scene name.
  @type Layers: integer (bitmask)
  @cvar Layers: The Scene layers (check also the easier to use
        L{layers<Scene.Scene.layers>}).  This value is a bitmask with at least
        one position set for the 20 possible layers starting from the low order
        bit.  The easiest way to deal with these values in in hexadecimal 
        notation.
        Example::
          scene.Layers = 0x04 # sets layer 3 ( bit pattern 0100 )
          scene.Layers |= 0x01
          print scene.Layers # will print: 5 ( meaning bit pattern 0101)
        After setting the Layers value, the interface (at least the 3d View and
        the Buttons window) needs to be redrawn to show the changes.
  @type layers: list of integers
  @cvar layers: The Scene layers (check also L{Layers<Scene.Scene.Layers>}).
        This attribute accepts and returns a list of integer values in the
        range [1, 20].
        Example::
          scene.layers = [3] # set layer 3
          scene.layers = scene.layers.append(1)
          print scene.layers # will print: [1, 3]

       means all objects from all available scenes.  In most cases (exporter

      an active one (if the user enters editmode, for example, this is the
      object that should become available for edition).  So what makes this
      scene method different from C{Object.GetSelected()[0]} is that it can
