  The Matrix Object
  =================
    This object gives access to Matrices in Blender.
  @ivar rowSize: The row size of the matrix.
  @ivar colSize: The column size of the matrix.
  @ivar wrapped: Whether or not this object wrapps internal data
  @note: Math can be performed on Matrix classes
      - mat + mat 
      - mat - mat 
      - mat * float/int
      - mat * vec
      - mat * mat 
  @note: Comparison operators can be done:
      - ==, != test numeric values within epsilon
  @note: You can access a quaternion object like a 2d sequence
      - x = matrix[0][1]
      - vector = matrix[2]
  @attention: Quaternion data can be wrapped or non-wrapped. When a object is wrapped it
  means that the object will give you direct access to the data inside of blender. Modification
  of this object will directly change the data inside of blender. To copy a wrapped object
  you need to use the object's constructor. If you copy and object by assignment you will not get
  a second copy but a second reference to the same data. Only certain functions will return 
  wrapped data. This will be indicated in the method description.
  Example::
      wrappedObject = Object.getAttribute() #this is wrapped data
      print wrappedObject.wrapped #prints 'True'
      copyOfObject = Object(wrappedObject) #creates a copy of the object
      secondPointer = wrappedObject #creates a second pointer to the same data
      print wrappedObject.attribute #prints '5'
      secondPointer.attribute = 10
      print wrappedObject.attribute #prints '10'
      print copyOfObject.attribute #prints '5'
