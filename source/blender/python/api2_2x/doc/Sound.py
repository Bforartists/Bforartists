# Blender.Sound module and the Sound PyType object

"""
The Blender.Sound submodule.

Sound
=====

This module provides access to B{Sound} objects in Blender.

Example::
  import Blender
  from Blender import Sound
  #
  sound = Sound.Load("/path/to/my/sound.wav")    # load a sound file
  print "Sound from", sound.filename,
  print "loaded to obj", sound.name
  print "All Sounds available now:", Sound.Get()

No way to get the actual audio data is provided by this library,
but it is included in the Python standard library (module audioop).
Note that using that module requires a full/normal Python installation.
