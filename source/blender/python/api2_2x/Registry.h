/* This submodule was introduced as a way to preserve configured data in
 * scripts.  A very simple idea: the script writer saves this data in a dict
 * and registers this dict in the "Registry" dict.  This way we can discard
 * the global interpreter dictionary after a script is executed, since the
 * data meant to be kept was copied to the Registry elsewhere.  The current
 * implementation is naive: scripts can deliberately mess with data saved by
 * other scripts.  This is so new script versions can delete older entries, if
 * they need to.  XXX Or should we block this? */
