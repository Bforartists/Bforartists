/* This header exposes BPyMenu related public declarations.  The implementation
 * adds 'dynamic' menus to Blender, letting scripts register themselves in any
 * of a few pre-defined (trivial to upgrade) places in menus.  These places or
 * slots are called groups here (Import, Export, etc).  This is how it works:
 * - scripts at dirs user pref U.pythondir and .blender/scripts/ are scanned
 * for registration info.
 * - this data is also saved to a Bpymenus file at the user's .blender/ dir and
 * only re-created when the scripts folder gets modified.
 * - on start-up Blender uses this info to fill a table, which is used to
 * create the menu entries when they are needed (see header_info.c or
 * header_script.c, under source/blender/src/, for examples).
*/

/* These two structs hold py menu/submenu info.
 * BPyMenu holds a script's name (as should appear in the menu) and filename,
 * plus an optional list of submenus.  Each submenu is related to a string
 * (arg) that the script can get from the __script__ pydict, to know which
 * submenu was chosen. */

 * - update the bpymenu_group_atoi() and BPyMenu_group_itoa() functions in
 * BPY_menus.c;
