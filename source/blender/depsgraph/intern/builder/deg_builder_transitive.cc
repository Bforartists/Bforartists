/* Performs a transitive reduction to remove redundant relations.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction
 *
 * XXX The current implementation is somewhat naive and has O(V*E) worst case
 * runtime.
 * A more optimized algorithm can be implemented later, e.g.
 *
 *   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397588900321/pdf?md5=3391e309b708b6f9cdedcd08f84f4afc&pid=1-s2.0-0304397588900321-main.pdf
 *
 * Care has to be taken to make sure the algorithm can handle the cyclic case
 * too! (unless we can to prevent this case early on).
