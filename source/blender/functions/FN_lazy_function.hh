 *
 * A `LazyFunction` encapsulates a computation which has inputs, outputs and potentially side
 * effects. Most importantly, a `LazyFunction` supports laziness in its inputs and outputs:
 * - Only outputs that are actually used have to be computed.
 * - Inputs can be requested lazily based on which outputs are used or what side effects the
 *   function has.
 *
 * A lazy-function that uses laziness may be executed more than once. The most common example is
 * the geometry nodes switch node. Depending on a condition input, it decides which one of the
 * other inputs is actually used. From the perspective of the switch node, its execution works as
 * follows:
 * 1. The switch node is first executed. It sees that the output is used. Now it requests the
 *    condition input from the caller and exits.
 * 2. Once the caller is able to provide the condition input the switch node is executed again.
 *    This time it retrieves the condition and requests one of the other inputs. Then the node
 *    exits again, giving back control to the caller.
 * 3. When the caller computed the second requested input the switch node executes a last time.
 *    This time it retrieves the new input and forwards it to the output.
 *
 * In some sense, a lazy-function can be thought of like a state machine. Every time it is
 * executed, it advances its state until all required outputs are ready.
 *
 * The lazy-function interface is designed to support composition of many such functions into a new
 * lazy-functions, all while keeping the laziness working. For example, in geometry nodes a switch
 * node in a node group should still be able to decide whether a node in the parent group will be
 * executed or not. This is essential to avoid doing unnecessary work.
 *
 * The lazy-function system consists of multiple core components:
 * - The interface of a lazy-function itself including its calling convention.
 * - A graph data structure that allows composing many lazy-functions by connecting their inputs
 *   and outputs.
 * - An executor that allows multi-threaded execution or such a graph.
