 * A platform-independent definition of [u]intXX_t
 * Plus the accompanying header include for htonl/ntohl
 *
 * This file includes <sys/types.h> to define [u]intXX_t types, where
 * XX can be 8, 16, 32 or 64. Unfortunately, not all systems have this
 * file.
 * - Windows uses __intXX compiler-builtin types. These are signed,
 *   so we have to flip the signs.
 * For these rogue platforms, we make the typedefs ourselves.
