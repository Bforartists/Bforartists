2008-03-06 - freestyle-2.2.0
	* Fixed a bug related to the ViewShape IDs that caused the ray casting to crash.
	* Fixed a bug in the style module insertion.
                
2008-03-02 - freestyle-2.1.1
	* Added the management of texture coordinates in the scene graph and the rendering.
	* The reps in the scene graph are now assigned ids based on the lib3ds nodes ids. These ids are transmitted to the WingedEdge Shapes.
2007-10-05 - freestyle-2.0.1

	* Enforced node construction from lib3ds (thanks to Thomas Netter)
        * Reverted to not using bundles by default on MacOSX. Activating bundles can be made by uncommenting the lib_bundle line of the CONFIG variable in Config.pri
        * Added a NodeCamera to the scene graph.
        * Made sure the display lists were compiled AND executed (GL_COMPILE -> GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE) for IndexedFaceSet.
        * Added a visitor to deallocate memory on the graphics card (display lists right now).
        * Modified the grid to use a visitor pattern for ray casting and grid traversal.

	* Added texture coordinates to scene graph
	* Made the grid more robust
        * Now compiles on MacOSX
        * Fixed the brush texture problem: the full path to the texture was used instead of the base name and that was breaking the search path algorithm
