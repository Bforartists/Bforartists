* Application doesn't exit properly (eg style window still hangs out)
* macosx: Window bar is unaccessible.
* macosx: Build leds to an application that is half-bundle (for the executable) half UNIX-style (for libraries).
* Strokes Strips are sometimes incorrect
* TVertex sometimes points towards NULL ViewEdges
* Some points are found to be outside of the grid. (for big models and mostly in release mode). Probably due to precision problems.
* Operators::recursiveChains() and ViewEdgeIterator change ViewEdgeIterator so that it supports the copy of specialized types in a transparent way. It works here only because we're never copying it and because it is passed as a reference.
* Functions0D takes a Interface0DIterator& insted of a const Interface0DIterator& as argument. dangerous.
* crashes on big models
