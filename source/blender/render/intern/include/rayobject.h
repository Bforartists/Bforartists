/* RayObject
	
	A ray object is everything where we can cast rays like:
		* a face/triangle
		* an octree
		* a bvh tree
		* an octree of bvh's
		* a bvh of bvh's
	
		
	All types of RayObjects can be created by implementing the
	callbacks of the RayObject.

	Due to high computing time evolved with casting on faces
	there is a special type of RayObject (named RayFace)
	which won't use callbacks like other generic nodes.
	
	In order to allow a mixture of RayFace+RayObjects,
	all RayObjects must be 4byte aligned, allowing us to use the
	2 least significant bits (with the mask 0x03) to define the
	type of RayObject.
	
	This leads to 4 possible types of RayObject:

	 addr&3  - type of object
		 0		Self (reserved for each structure)
		1     	RayFace (tri/quad primitive)
		2		RayObject (generic with API callbacks)
		3		VlakPrimitive
				(vlak primitive - to be used when we have a vlak describing the data
				 eg.: on render code)

	0 means it's reserved and has it own meaning inside each ray acceleration structure
	(this way each structure can use the allign offset to determine if a node represents a
	 RayObject primitive, which can be used to save memory)

	You actually don't need to care about this if you are only using the API
	described on RE_raytrace.h
