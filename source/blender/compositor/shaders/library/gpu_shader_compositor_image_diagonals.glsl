 * the smaller of the width and height of the matrix. The linearly increasing and constant parts of
 * the sequence can be described using the following compact equation:
 *
 *   Length => min(Longest Length, index + 1)
 *
 * While the constant and deceasing end parts of the sequence can be described using the following
 * compact equation:
 *
 *   Length => min(Longest Length, Number Of Diagonals - index)

 * All three parts of the sequence can then be combined using the minimum operation because they
