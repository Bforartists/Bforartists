/**
 * \brief The main method that is used to execute the compositor tree.
 * It can be executed during editing (`blenkernel/node.cc`) or rendering
 * (`renderer/pipeline.cc`).
 *
 * \param render: Render instance for GPU context.
 *
 * \param render_data: Render data for this composite, this won't always belong to a scene.
 *
 * \param node_tree: Reference to the compositor editing tree
 *
 * \param rendering: This parameter determines whether the function is called from rendering
 *    (true) or editing (false).
 *    based on this setting the system will work differently:
 *     - during rendering only Composite & the File output node will be calculated
 * \see NodeOperation.is_output_program(bool rendering) of the specific operations
 *
 *     - during editing all output nodes will be calculated
 * \see NodeOperation.is_output_program(bool rendering) of the specific operations
 *
 *     - another quality setting can be used bNodeTree.
 *       The quality is determined by the bNodeTree fields.
 *       quality can be modified by the user from within the node panels.
 *
 *     - output nodes can have different priorities in the WorkScheduler.
 * This is implemented in the COM_execute function.
 *
 * OCIO_TODO: this options only used in rare cases, namely in output file node,
 *            so probably this settings could be passed in a nicer way.
 *            should be checked further, probably it'll be also needed for preview
 *            generation in display space
