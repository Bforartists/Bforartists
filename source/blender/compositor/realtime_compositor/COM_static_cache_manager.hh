/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Static Cache Manager
 *
 * A static cache manager is a collection of cached resources that can be retrieved when needed and
 * created if not already available. In particular, each cached resource type has its own instance
 * of a container derived from the CachedResourceContainer type in the class. All instances of that
 * cached resource type are stored and tracked in the container. See the CachedResource and
 * CachedResourceContainer classes for more information.
 *
 * The manager deletes the cached resources that are no longer needed. A cached resource is said to
 * be not needed when it was not used in the previous evaluation. This is done through the
 * following mechanism:
 *
 * - Before every evaluation, do the following:
 *     1. All resources whose CachedResource::needed flag is false are deleted.
 *     2. The CachedResource::needed flag of all remaining resources is set to false.
 * - During evaluation, when retrieving any cached resource, set its CachedResource::needed flag to
 *   true.
 *
 * In effect, any resource that was used in the previous evaluation but was not used in the current
 * evaluation will be deleted before the next evaluation. This mechanism is implemented in the
 * reset() method of the class, which should be called before every evaluation. */
