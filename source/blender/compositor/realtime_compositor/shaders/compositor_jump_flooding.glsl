 *   and distance transform." Proceedings of the 2006 symposium on Interactive 3D graphics and

 * The shader is a straightforward implementation of the aforementioned sections of the paper,

 * The gpu_shader_compositor_jump_flooding_lib.glsl library contains the necessary utility
 * functions to initialize, encode, and extract the information in the jump flooding values. */
