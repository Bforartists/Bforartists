 * Asset-handle is a temporary design, not part of the core asset system design.
 *
 * Currently asset-list items are just file directory items (#FileDirEntry). So an asset-handle
 * just wraps a pointer to this. We try to abstract away the fact that it's just a file entry,
 * although that doesn't always work (see #rna_def_asset_handle()).
