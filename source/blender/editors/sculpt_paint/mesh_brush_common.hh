/**
 * This file contains common operations useful for the implementation of various different brush
 * tools. The design goals of the API are to always operate on more than one data element at a
 * time, to avoid unnecessary branching for constants, favor cache-friendly access patterns, enable
 * use of SIMD, and provide opportunities to avoid work where possible.
 *
 * API function arguments should favor passing raw data references rather than general catch-all
 * storage structs in order to clarify the scope of each function, structure the work around the
 * required data, and limit redundant data storage.
 *
 * Many functions calculate "factors" which describe how strong the brush influence should be
 * between 0 and 1. Most functions multiply with the existing factor value rather than assigning a
 * new value from scratch.
