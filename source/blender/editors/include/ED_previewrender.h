pr_method:
- PR_DRAW_RENDER: preview is rendered and drawn, as indicated by called context (buttons panel)
- PR_ICON_RENDER: the preview is not drawn and the function is not dynamic,
  so no events are processed. Hopefully fast enough for at least 32x32 
- PR_DO_RENDER: preview is rendered, not drawn, but events are processed for afterqueue,
  in use for node editor now.
