/**
 * VKScheduler is responsible for selecting and reordering of nodes in the render graph. This
 * selection and order is used to convert the nodes to commands and submitting it to the GPU.
 *
 * This scheduler selects all nodes in the order they were added to the render graph.
 *
 * This is an initial implementation and should be enhanced for:
 * - Moving data transfer and compute before drawing, when they are scheduled between drawing nodes
 *   that use the same pipeline.
 * - Only select the nodes that are only needed for the given vk_image/vk_buffer. When performing
 *   read-backs of buffers should be done with as least as possible nodes as they can block
 *   drawing. It is better to do handle most nodes just before presenting the image. This would
 *   lead to less CPU locks.
 * - Pruning branches that are not linked to anything. EEVEE can add debug commands that would
 *   eventually not been displayed on screen. These branches should be pruned. The challenge is
 *   that we need to know for certain that it isn't used in a not submitted part of the graph.
 *
 * TODO: Walking the render graph isn't implemented yet. The idea is to have a
 * `Map<ResourceWithStamp, Vector<NodeHandle>> consumers` and `Map<ResourceWithStamp, NodeHandle>
 * producers`. These attributes can be stored in the render graph and created when building the
 * links, or can be created inside the VKScheduler as a variable. The exact detail which one would
 * be better is unclear as there aren't any users yet. At the moment the scheduler would need them
 * we need to figure out the best way to store and retrieve the consumers/producers.
