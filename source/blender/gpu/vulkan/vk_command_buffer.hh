   * Some vulkan command require an active frame buffer. Others require no active frame-buffer. As
   * our current API does not provide a solution for this we need to keep track of the actual state
   * and do the changes when recording the next command.
   *
   * This is a temporary solution to get things rolling.
   * TODO: In a future solution we should decide the scope of a command buffer.
   *
   * - command buffer per draw command.
   * - minimize command buffers and track render passes.
   * - add custom encoder to also track resource usages.
   *
   * Currently I expect the custom encoder has to be done eventually. But want to keep postponing
   * the custom encoder for now to collect more use cases it should solve. (first pixel drawn on
   * screen).
   *
   * Some command can also be encoded in another way when encoded as a first command. For example
   * clearing a frame-buffer textures isn't allowed inside a render pass, but clearing the
   * frame-buffer textures via ops is allowed. When clearing a frame-buffer texture directly after
   * beginning a render pass could be re-encoded to do this in the same command.
   *
   * So for now we track the state and temporary switch to another state if the command requires
   * it.
