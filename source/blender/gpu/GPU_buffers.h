   GL state changes that can't occur in the middle of drawing an
   array.

   some simplifying assumptions are made:
   * all quads are treated as two triangles.
   * no vertex sharing is used; each triangle gets its own copy of the
     vertices it uses (this makes it easy to deal with a vertex used
     by faces with different properties, such as smooth/solid shading,
     different MCols, etc.)

   to avoid confusion between the original MVert vertices and the
   arrays of OpenGL vertices, the latter are referred to here and in
   the source as `points'. similarly, the OpenGL triangles generated
   for MFaces are referred to as triangles rather than faces.
