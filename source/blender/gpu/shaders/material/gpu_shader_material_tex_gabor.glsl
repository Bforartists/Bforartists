/* The original Gabor noise paper specifies that the impulses count for each cell should be
 * computed by sampling a Poisson distribution whose mean is the impulse density. However,
 * Tavernier's paper showed that stratified Poisson point sampling is better assuming the weights
 * are sampled using a Bernoulli distribution, as shown in Figure (3). By stratified sampling, they
 * mean a constant number of impulses per cell, so the stratification is the grid itself in that
 * sense, as described in the supplementary material of the paper. */

/* Computes a 2D Gabor kernel based on Equation (6) in the original Gabor noise paper. Where the
 * frequency argument is the F_0 parameter and the orientation argument is the w_0 parameter. We
 * assume the Gaussian envelope has a unit magnitude, that is, K = 1. That is because we will
 * eventually normalize the final noise value to the unit range, so the multiplication by the
 * magnitude will be canceled by the normalization. Further, we also assume a unit Gaussian width,
 * that is, a = 1. That is because it does not provide much artistic control. It follows that the
 * Gaussian will be truncated at pi.
 *
 * To avoid the discontinuities caused by the aforementioned truncation, the Gaussian is windowed
 * using a Hann window, that is because contrary to the claim made in the original Gabor paper,
 * truncating the Gaussian produces significant artifacts especially when differentiated for bump
 * mapping. The Hann window is C1 continuous and has limited effect on the shape of the Gaussian,
 * so it felt like an appropriate choice.
 *
 * Finally, instead of computing the Gabor value directly, we instead use the complex phasor
 * formulation described in section 3.1.1 in Tricard's paper. That's done to be able to compute the
 * phase and intensity of the Gabor noise after summation based on equations (8) and (9). The
 * return value of the Gabor kernel function is then a complex number whose real value is the
 * value computed in the original Gabor noise paper, and whose imaginary part is the sine
 * counterpart of the real part, which is the only extra computation in the new formulation.
 *
 * Note that while the original Gabor noise paper uses the cosine part of the phasor, that is, the
 * real part of the phasor, we use the sine part instead, that is, the imaginary part of the
 * phasor, as suggested by Tavernier's paper in "Section 3.3. Instance stationarity and
 * normalization", to ensure a zero mean, which should help with normalization. */
