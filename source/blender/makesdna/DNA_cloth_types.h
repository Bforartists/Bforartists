/**
* This struct contains all the global data required to run a simulation.
* At the time of this writing, this structure contains data appropriate
* to run a simulation as described in Deformation Constraints in a
* Mass-Spring Model to Describe Rigid Cloth Behavior by Xavier Provot.
*
* I've tried to keep similar, if not exact names for the variables as
* are presented in the paper.  Where I've changed the concept slightly,
* as in stepsPerFrame comapred to the time step in the paper, I've used
* variables with different names to minimize confusion.
