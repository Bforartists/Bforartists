/** \file

 * \section aboutmain Main struct
 * Main is the root of the 'data-base' of a Blender context. All data is put into lists, and all
 * these lists are stored here.
 *
 * \note A Blender file is not much more than a binary dump of these lists. This list of lists is
 * not serialized itself.
 *
 * \note `BKE_main` files are for operations over the Main database itself, or generating extra
 * temp data to help working with it. Those should typically not affect the data-blocks themselves.
 *
 * \section Function Names
 *
 * - `BKE_main_` should be used for functions in that file.
