 *  o Make drawMapped* functions take a predicate function that
 *    determines whether to draw the edge (this predicate can
 *    also set color, etc). This will be slightly more general 
 *    and allow some of the functions to be collapsed.
 *  o Once accessor functions are added then single element draw
 *    functions can be implemented using primitive accessors.
 *  o Add function to dispatch to renderer instead of using
 *    conversion to DLM.
