/**
 * Editing of datablocks from asset libraries.
 *
 * Asset blend files are linked into the global main database, with the asset
 * datablock itself and its dependencies. These datablocks remain linked but
 * are marked as editable.
 *
 * User edited asset datablocks are written to individual blend files per
 * asset. These blend files include any datablock dependencies and packaged
 * image files.
 *
 * This way the blend file can be easily saved, reloaded and deleted.
 *
 * This mechanism is currently only used for brush assets.
