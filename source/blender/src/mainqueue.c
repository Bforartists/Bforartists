/**
 * \file mainqueue.c
 * \brief Just the functions to maintain a central event queue.
 * 
 * Creates the functionality of a FIFO queue for events.
 *
 * \note The documentor (me) doesn't know the full description of 
 * the fields of the QEvent structure, and the parameters to the 
 * functions (event, val, ascii).  The comments should be updated
 * with more detailed descriptions of what is stored in each one.
 *
 * \warning This queue structure uses a method that assumes the presence
 * of allocated memory.  As well it doesn't de-allocate memory after
 * a read off of the queue, thereby causing a situation whereby memory
 * isn't being freed and can grow with out bound even though there is
 * a limit on the queue size.
