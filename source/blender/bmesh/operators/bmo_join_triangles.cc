/**
 * This define allows a developer to interrupt the operator midway through
 * to visualize and debug the actions being taken by the merge algorithm.
 *
 * This define could be enabled for all debug builds, even when the `merge_limit` or
 * `neighbor_debug` parameters might not be being passed. For example, if the API interface
 * is turned off in `editmesh_tools.cc`, or if join_triangles is called from other operators
 * such as convex_hull that don't expose the testing API, the testing code still behaves.
 * When merge_limit and `neighbor_debug` are left unset, the default values pick the
 * normal processing path.
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * `merge_limit` selects how many merges are performed before stopping in the middle to
 * visualize intermediate results.
 * In the UI, this has a range of `-1...n`, but in the operator parameters, this is actually
 * passed as `0...n+1`. This allows the default '0' in the parameter to be a sensible default.
 *
 * `neighbor_debug` allows each step in the neighbor improvement process to be visualized.
 * When nonzero, the quad that was merged and the two triangles being considered for adjustment
 * are left selected for visualization. Additionally, the neighbor quads are adjusted to their
 * "flattened" position to be in-plane with the quad, to allow visualization of that.
 * The numerical values related to the improvements are printed to the text console.
 *
 * `merge_limit = -1` allows the algorithm to run fully.
 * `merge_limit = 0` stops before the first merge.
 * `neighbor_debug` can be stepped to diagnose every neighbor improvement
 * that occurs as a result of the pre-existing quads in the mesh (valid
 * range for `neighbor_debug = 0...8*(number of selected pre-existing quads)`
 * `merge_limit = 1, 2, 3...` stops after the specified number of merges.
 * `neighbor_debug` shows the neighbor improvements for the last quad that merged.
 * (Valid range 0...8)
 *
 * Testing
 * =======
 *
 * To turn on interactive testing, the developer needs to:
 * - enable #USE_JOIN_TRIANGLE_INTERACTIVE_TESTING here.
 * - enable #USE_JOIN_TRIANGLE_INTERACTIVE_TESTING in `bmesh_opdefines.cc`.
 * - enable #USE_JOIN_TRIANGLE_TESTING_API in `editmesh_tools.cc`.

 * This means a quad with a higher error can end up preferred - when it creates better topology -
 * even though there might be an alternate quad with lower numerical error.
 *
 * This algorithm reduces the error of a given edge based on three factors:
 * - The error of the neighboring quad. The the better the neighbor quad, the more the impact.
 * - The alignment of the proposed new quad the existing quad.
 *   Grids of rectangles or trapezoids improve well. Trapezoids and diamonds are left alone.
 * - topology_influence. The higher the operator parameter is set, the more the impact.
 *   To help counteract the alignment penalty, topology_influence is permitted to exceed 100%.
 *
 * Because of the reduction due to misalignment, this will reduce the error of an edge, to be
 * closer to the error of the known good quad, and increase its changes of being merged sooner.
 * However, some of the edge's error always remains - it never is made *equal* to the lower error
 * from the good face. This means the influence of an exceptionally good quad will fade away with
 * each successive, neighbor, instead of affecting the *entire* mesh. This is desirable.
