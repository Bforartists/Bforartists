/*
	I wrote this as a hack so vgroups won't be quite so slow.  I really
	should replace it with something else, but I need to spend some time
	thinking as to what the proper solution would be (other then totally
	rewriting vgroups, of course).

	this is just a simple allocator that spawns mempools for unique size
	requests.  hardly ideal, I know.  *something* like this may be
	unavoidable, but it should certainly be possible to make it
	non-global and internal to the vgroup code.
