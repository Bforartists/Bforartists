/*
 this evil bit of code is necassary for vgroups and multires to run fast
 enough.  it is surprisingly tricky allocate MDeformWeights and MDisps in
 a way that doesn't cause severe performance problems.  once a better solution
 is found we can get rid of this code, but until then this is necassary
 (though, disabling it if jedmalloc is in use might be feasible).
