/**
 * A `SharedCache` is meant to share lazily computed data between equivalent objects. It allows
 * saving unnecessary computation by making a calculated value accessible from any object that
 * shares the cache. Unlike `CacheMutex`, the cached data is embedded inside of this object.
 *
 * When data is copied (copy-on-write before changing a mesh, for example), the cache is shared,
 * allowing its calculation on either the source or original to make the result available on both
 * objects. As soon as either object is changed in a way that invalidates the cache, the data is
 * "un-shared", and they will no-longer influence each other.
 *
 * One important use case is a typical CoW update loop of a persistent geometry data-block in
 * `Main`. Even if bounds are only calculated on the evaluated *copied* geometry, if nothing
 * changes them, they only need to be calculated on the first evaluation, because the same
 * evaluated bounds are also accessible from the original geometry.
 *
 * The cache is implemented with a shared pointer, so it is relatively cheap, but to avoid
 * unnecessary overhead it should only be used for relatively expensive computations.
