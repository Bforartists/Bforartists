/**
 * #ImplicitSharingInfo is the core data structure for implicit sharing in Blender. Implicit
 * sharing is a technique that avoids copying data when it is not necessary. This results in better
 * memory usage and performance. Only read-only data can be shared, because otherwise multiple
 * owners might want to change the data in conflicting ways.
 *
 * To determine whether data is shared, #ImplicitSharingInfo keeps a user count. If the count is 1,
 * the data only has a single owner and is therefore mutable. If some code wants to modify data
 * that is currently shared, it has to make a copy first.
 * This behavior is also called "copy on write".
 *
 * In addition to containing the reference count, #ImplicitSharingInfo also knows how to destruct
 * the referenced data. This is important because the code freeing the data in the end might not
 * know how it was allocated (for example, it doesn't know whether an array was allocated using the
 * system or guarded allocator).
 *
 * #ImplicitSharingInfo can be used in two ways:
 * - It can be allocated separately from the referenced data. This is used when the shared data is
 *   e.g. a plain data array.
 * - It can be embedded into another struct. For that it's best to use #ImplicitSharingMixin.
