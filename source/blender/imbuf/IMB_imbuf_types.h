/**
 * IMB_imbuf_types.h (mar-2001 nzc)
 *
 * Types needed for using the image buffer.
 *
 * Imbuf is external code, slightly adapted to live in the Blender
 * context. It requires an external jpeg module, and the avi-module
 * (also external code) in order to function correctly.
 *
 * This file contains types and some constants that go with them. Most
 * are self-explanatory (e.g. IS_amiga tests whether the buffer
 * contains an Amiga-format file).

 * WORK CORRECTLY!
 *
 * Also; add new variables to the end to save pain!
 *
 * Also, that iff.h needs to be in the final release "plugins/include" dir, too!
