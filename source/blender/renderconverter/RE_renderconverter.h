 * Interface to transform the Blender scene into renderable data.
 *
 * @mainpage RE - Blender RE-converter external interface
 *
 * @section about About the RE-converter module
 *
 * The converter takes a Blender scene, and transforms the data into
 * renderer-specific data.
 *
 * Conversions:
 * 
 * halos: (world settings) stars ->
 *        some particle effects  ->
 *        meshes with halo prop  ->  
 *                                  HaloRen (made by inithalo)
 *
 *
 *                                  VlakRen (face render data)
 * Each vlakren needs several VertRens to make sense.
 *                                  VertRen (vertex render data)
 *
 * @section issues Known issues with RE-converter
