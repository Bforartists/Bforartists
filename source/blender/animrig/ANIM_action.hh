   * 2. All fcurves should point back to the group they belong to (if any) via

   * etc.). The groups are then updated so their starting index matches this.
   * Then the fcurves' `grp` pointer is updated, so that any changes in group
   * membership is correctly reflected.
   *
   * For example, if the mapping of groups to fcurves looks like this (g* are
   * the groups, dots indicate ungrouped areas, and f* are the fcurves, so e.g.
   * group g0 currently contains f1 and f2, but ought to contain f0 and f1):

   * ```
   *
   * Then after calling this function they will look like this:
   *
   * ```
   * | g0  |g1| g2  |..............|
   * |f0|f1|f2|f3|f4|f5|f6|f7|f8|f9|
   * ```
   *
   * Note that this specifically does *not* move the fcurves, but rather moves
   * the groups *over* the fcurves, changing membership.
   *
   * The `grp` pointers in the fcurves are then updated to reflect their new
   * group membership, using the groups as the source of truth.
