/**
 * Container of animation data for one or more animated IDs.
 *
 * An Action broadly consists of four things:
 *
 * 1. Layers, which contain Strips.
 * 2. Strips, which reference StripData.
 * 3. StripData: Strip{TYPE}Data contains animation data of the given type. For
 *    example, StripKeyframeData (currently the only StripData type) contains
 *    keyframes.
 * 4. Slots, which are used as identifiers for subsets of animation data within
 *    StripData items.
 *
 * StripData is not stored in the Strips themselves, but rather is stored
 * separately at the top level of the Action, and each Strip *references* a
 * StripData item. This allows Strip instancing by having more than one Strip
 * reference the same StripData item.
 *
 * Each Action has a set of Slots defined at its top level. The animation data
 * within a StripData item is organized into one or more subsets, each of which
 * is marked as being for a different Slot.
 *
 * For an ID to be animated by an Action, the ID must specify both an Action and
 * a Slot within that Action. The Slot that the ID uses determines which subset
 * of the animation data throughout the Action it is animated by. If an Action
 * but no Slot is specified, the ID is simply not animated.
 *
 * \note Temporary limitations: each Action can only contain one Layer, and each
 * Layer can only contain one infinite Strip with no time offset. These
 * limitations will be progressively lifted as we implement layered animation
 * and non-linear animation functionality for Actions in the future. (See:
 * `assert_baklava_phase_1_invariants()`.)
 *
 * \note This wrapper class for the `bAction` DNA struct only has functionality
 * for the layered animation data. The legacy F-Curves (in `bAction::curves`)
 * and their groups (in `bAction::groups`) are not managed here.
 *
 * To continue supporting legacy actions at runtime, there are
 * `Action::is_action_legacy()` and `Action::is_action_layered()` that report
 * whether an Action uses that legacy F-Curve data or is instead a layered
 * Action. These methods will eventually be removed when runtime support for
 * legacy actions is fully removed. For code in blend file loading and
 * versioning, which will stick around for the long-term, use
 * `animrig::versioning::action_is_layered()` instead. (Note that an empty
 * Action is considered both a valid legacy *and* layered action.)
