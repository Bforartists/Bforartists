Welcome to the fun world of open source.

For instructions on building and installing Blender, please see the file named
INSTALL.


---------------------.Blanguages and the .blender directory---------------------

The .blender directory holds various data files for Blender.
In the 2.28a release those are the .Blanguages file containing a list of
translations, the translations themselves and a default ttf font.

Blender checks for the presence of this directory in several locations:
	- the current directory
	- your home directory
	- On OSX, the blender bundle is also checked 
	- On Windows, the installation dir is checked.

If you get a 'File ".Blanguages" not found' warning, try to copy the .blender
dir to one of these locations (your home directory being recommended).
