#
# This is a build system used by platform maintainers to build library dependencies on
# Windows, macOS and Linux.
#
# For users building Blender, we recommend using the precompiled libraries from lib/ on
# Windows and macOS, and install_deps.sh on Linux.
#
# WINDOWS USAGE:
#   Don't call this cmake file yourself, use build_deps.cmd
#   build_deps 2013 x64 / build_deps 2013 x86
#   build_deps 2015 x64 / build_deps 2015 x86
#
# MAC OS X USAGE:
#   Install with homebrew: brew install cmake autoconf automake libtool yasm nasm
#   Run "make deps" from main Blender directory
#
# LINUX USAGE:
#   Install compiler cmake autoconf automake libtool yasm nasm tcl
#   Run "make deps" from main Blender directory
