# Signing process overview.
#
# From buildbot worker side:
#  - Files which needs to be signed are collected from either a directory to
#    sign all signable files in there, or by filename of a single file to sign.
#  - Those files gets packed into an archive and stored in a location location
#    which is watched by the signing server.
#  - A marker READY file is created which indicates the archive is ready for
#    access.
#  - Wait for the server to provide an archive with signed files.
#    This is done by watching for the READY file which corresponds to an archive
#    coming from the signing server.
#  - Unpack the signed signed files from the archives and replace original ones.
#
# From code sign server:
#  - Watch special location for a READY file which indicates the there is an
#    archive with files which are to be signed.
#  - Unpack the archive to a temporary location.
#  - Run codesign tool and make sure all the files are signed.
#  - Pack the signed files and store them in a location which is watched by
#    the buildbot worker.
#  - Create a READY file which indicates that the archive with signed files is
#    ready.
