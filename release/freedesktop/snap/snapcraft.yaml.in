    Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the
    entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation,
    rendering, compositing and motion tracking, and video editing.

    Blender is a public project, made by hundreds of people from around the
    world; by studios and individual artists, professionals and hobbyists,
    scientists, students, VFX experts, animators, game artists, modders, and
    the list goes on.

    The standard snap channels are used in the following way:

           stable - Latest stable release.
        candidate - Test builds for the upcoming stable release.
