    Return an image from the file path with options to search multiple paths
    and return a placeholder if its not found.

    :arg filepath: The image filename
       If a path precedes it, this will be searched as well.

    :arg dirname: is the directory where the image may be located - any file at
       the end will be ignored.

       this is useful so later you can relink the image to its original data.

    :arg recursive: If True, directories will be recursively searched.
       Be careful with this if you have files in your root directory because
       it may take a long time.

       a new one. Use this when loading image formats blender may not support,
       the CONVERT_CALLBACK can take the path for a GIF (for example),
       convert it to a PNG and return the PNG's path.
       For formats blender can read, simply return the path that is given.
