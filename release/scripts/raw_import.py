This script imports Raw Triangle File format files to Blender.

The raw triangle format is very simple; it has no verts or faces lists.
It's just a simple ascii text file with the vertices of each triangle
listed on each line. There were some very old utilities (when the PovRay
forum was in existence on CompuServe) that preformed operations on these
files.

Usage:<br>
	Execute this script from the "File->Import" menu and choose a Raw file to
open.

Notes:<br>
	Generates the standard verts and faces lists, but without duplicate
verts. Only *exact* duplicates are removed, there is no way to specify a
tolerance.
