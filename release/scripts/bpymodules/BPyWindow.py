# DESCRIPTION:
# screen_x, screen_y the origin point of the pick ray
# it is either the mouse location
# localMatrix is used if you want to have the returned values in an objects localspace.
#    this is usefull when dealing with an objects data such as verts.
# or if useMid is true, the midpoint of the current 3dview
# returns
# Origin - the origin point of the pick ray
# Direction - the direction vector of the pick ray
# in global coordinates
epsilon = 1e-3 # just a small value to account for floating point errors
