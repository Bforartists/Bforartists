## INFO ##
# This add-on adds top-level brush presets into a new toolshelf tab and brush panels you can collapse, pin or use.
# The panels update depending on how many brush presets you have per brush group.
# The buttons also highlight when activated, and the list updates when you create and remove brushes.
# The iconography also updates to custom icons when they are defined by the user.
# The panel also is responsive with the standard 1,2,3 and text row format defined by Bforartists.
# In use cases, this has already proven a huge time saver when weighting rigs - very intuitive.
