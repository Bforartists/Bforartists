    # Allow the user to specify a new resolution factor for reloading the

    # a scene with a low resolution terrain map, apply textures, modifiers,
    # etc. and then increase the resolution to prepare for final rendering.
    #
    # Displaying this value as a percentage (0, 100] is an intuitive way
    # for users to grasp what this value does. The DTM importer, however,
    # wants to recieve a value between (0, 1]. This is obviously a
    # straightforward conversion:
    #
    #     f(x) = x / 100
    #
    # But this conversion should happen here, in the terrain panel, rather
    # than in the DTM importing utility itself. We can't pass get/set
    # functions to the property itself because they result in a recursion
    # error. Instead, we use another, hidden, property to store the scaled
    # resolution.
