Tissue - Blender's add-on for computational design by Co-de-iT
http://www.co-de-it.com/wordpress/code/blender-tissue

Tissue is already shipped with both Blender. However I recommend to update the default version downloading manually the most recent one, for more updated features and more stability.

### Blender 2.93

Tissue v0.3.52 for Blender 2.93 (latest stable release): https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue/releases/tag/v0-3-52

Development branch (usually the most updated version): https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue/tree/b290-dev

### Blender 2.79 (unsupported)

Tissue v0.3.4 for Blender 2.79b (latest stable release): https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue/releases/tag/v0-3-4

Development branch (most updated version): https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue/tree/dev1


### Installation:

1. Start Blender. Go to "Edit" and then "Preferences"
2. Open the "Add-ons" preferences
3. Click "install..." and point Blender at the downloaded zip file (on OSX it may have extracted the zip automatically, that won't work, so you have to zip the extracted folder again)
4. You may see now two different versions of Tissue, activate only the second one and ignore the first one

Tissue is free and open-source. I really think that this is the power of Blender and I wanted to give my small contribution to it.
