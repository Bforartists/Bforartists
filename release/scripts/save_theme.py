This script saves the current Theme in Blender as a Blender Python script.

Usage:

Use Blender's Theme tab in the User Preferences window to create and name your
theme, then run this script from the File->Export menu to save it.

It is saved as a bpython script, meaning that you can simply run it to change
the current theme.  By default it is currently saved under the
"Misc" group, available only from the Scripts window "Scripts->Misc" menu.

To appear in the menu, a theme saved with this script must be put in your
Blender's scripts dir, that's what happens by default when you save one by
yourself.  If you don't know where this dir is, running

import Blender<br>print Blender.Get("scriptsdir")

on the Text Editor window (use menu or ALT+P to run it) will write the path on
the console.

Remember to edit your exported theme's source file to put your name and
some information on it before sharing it with others.
