#  Author   : Stephane Grabli
#  Date     : 04/08/2005
#  Purpose  : Selects the lines that are long and have a high anisotropic 
#             a priori density and uses causal density 
#             to draw without cluttering. Ideally, half of the
#             selected lines are culled using the causal density.
#
#             ********************* WARNING *************************************
#             ******** The Directional a priori density maps must          ****** 
#             ******** have been computed prior to using this style module ******
