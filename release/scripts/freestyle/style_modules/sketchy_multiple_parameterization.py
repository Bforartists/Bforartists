#  Filename : sketchy_multiple_parameterization.py
#  Author   : Stephane Grabli
#  Date     : 04/08/2005
#  Purpose  : Builds sketchy strokes whose topology relies on a 
#             parameterization that covers the complete lines (visible+invisible)
#             whereas only the visible portions are actually drawn
