This folder is for automatically saved scripts configuration data.
This data is loaded when Blender starts and saved whenever a .blend file is
saved.

To use this feature scripts just need to set a Blender.Registry key with the
extension ".cfg" (for example, "myscript.cfg").

Please check the API Reference doc or the documentation for the
"Scripts Config Editor" script with the Help menu-> "Scripts Help Browser"
script in Blender.
