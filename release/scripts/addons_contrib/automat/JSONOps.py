def inflateFile(mat, fileToInflate, x=0, y=0):

    """
This method sets up a material saved to a JSON file. It returns a dictionary of
nodes with their labels as keys. The nodes are added to the specified material.

_Usage_: inflateFile(<reference to material the nodes are added to>,
<path of the file to load>, [optional <translation of the final node setup on the x axis>, <translation of the final node setup on the y axis>])

The syntax of the JSON file must be as follows:

1. Opening declaration (this may later be extended to create operators automatically and contain operator metadata):

{
"NodeSetup":[

2. Nodes as follows

{
    "label": "<label for the node>", - the node's mandatory identifier
    "type": "<the type of the node>, - the node's type (mandatory)
    "location": [<x>, <y>], - the node's mandatory location
    "in": [
              [<node>, <output>, (mandatoy) <input>],
                              <etc.>
          ] - (optional) Links going in to the node. Parameters:

            * The node whose output we take
            * Which output we take (can either be the display name, or
              the index of the output. In the former case, must be written
              as such: "\"<name>\"". In the later case, can be written as
              either <index> or "<index>".)
            * (optional) The input the connection goes into. The syntax is
              as per above. If omitted, links go into inputs in numerical
              order from top to bottom.
},

<etc.>

Note: Nodes can be accessed in more depth. For accessing the blend_mode of
a MixRGB, for example, one would write eg. (python):

    <node>.blend_mode = "MULTIPLY"

From JSON, this can be written as:

    "blend_mode": "\"MULTIPLY\""

For setting default values of inputs, use the following syntaxes:

    "inputs[0].default_value": 1
or

    "inputs[\"Color\"].default_value": [0, 1, 0, 1]

3. Closing declaration as follows:

]
}

The file is read using Python's built-in JSON parser, so indentation or line breaks are optional."""
