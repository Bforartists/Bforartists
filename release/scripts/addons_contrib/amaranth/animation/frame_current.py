Current Frame Slider

Currently the only way to change the current frame is to have a Timeline
editor open, but sometimes you don't have one, or you're fullscreen.
This option adds the Current Frame slider to the Specials menu. Find it
hitting the W menu in Object mode, you can slide or click in the middle
of the button to set the frame manually.
