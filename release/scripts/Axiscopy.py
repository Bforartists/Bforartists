This script copies the axis orientation -- X, Y and Z rotations -- of the
active object to all selected meshes.

It's useful to align the orientations of all meshes of a structure, a human
skeleton, for example.

Usage:

Select all mesh objects that need to have their orientations changed
(reminder: keep SHIFT pressed after the first, to add each new one to the
selection), then select the object whose orientation will be copied from and
finally run this script to update the angles.

Notes:<br>
    This script changes mesh data: the vertices are transformed.<br>
	Before copying the orientation to each object, the script stores its
transformation matrix.	Then the angles are copied and after that the object's
vertices are transformed "back" so that they still have the same positions as
before.  In other words, the rotations are updated, but you won't notice that
just from looking at the objects.<br>
	Checking their X, Y and Z rotation values with "Transform Properties" in
the 3D View's Object menu shows the angles are now the same of the active
object. Or simply look at the transform manipulator handles in local transform
orientation.
