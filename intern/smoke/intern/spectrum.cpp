           This program is in the public domain.

    For complete information about the techniques employed in
    this program, see the World-Wide Web document:

             http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/specrend/
	     
    The xyz_to_rgb() function, which was wrong in the original
    version of this program, was corrected by:
    
	    Andrew J. S. Hamilton 21 May 1999
	    Andrew.Hamilton@Colorado.EDU
	    http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/

    who also added the gamma correction facilities and
    modified constrain_rgb() to work by desaturating the
    colour by adding white.
    
    A program which uses these functions to plot CIE
    "tongue" diagrams called "ppmcie" is included in
    the Netpbm graphics toolkit:
    	http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/
    (The program was called cietoppm in earlier
    versions of Netpbm.)

    trivially as 1-(x+y)), and a desired chromaticity (XC, YC,
    ZC) in CIE space, determine the contribution of each

    chromaticity.  If the  requested chromaticity falls outside
    the Maxwell  triangle (colour gamut) formed by the three
    primaries, one of the r, g, or b weights will be negative. 

    Caller can use constrain_rgb() to desaturate an
    outside-gamut colour to the closest representation within
    the available gamut and/or norm_rgb to normalise the RGB
    components so the largest nonzero component has value 1.
