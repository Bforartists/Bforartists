/* Note on kernel_scene_intersect kernel.
 * This is the second kernel in the ray tracing logic. This is the first
 * of the path iteration kernels. This kernel takes care of scene_intersect function.
 *
 * This kernel changes the ray_state of RAY_REGENERATED rays to RAY_ACTIVE.
 * This kernel processes rays of ray state RAY_ACTIVE
 * This kernel determines the rays that have hit the background and changes their ray state to RAY_HIT_BACKGROUND.
 *
 * The input and output are as follows,
 *
 * Ray_coop ---------------------------------------|--------- kernel_scene_intersect----------|--- PathState
 * PathState_coop ---------------------------------|                                          |--- Intersection
 * ray_state --------------------------------------|                                          |--- ray_state
 * use_queues_flag --------------------------------|                                          |
 * parallel_samples -------------------------------|                                          |
 * QueueData(QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS) ---|                                          |
 * kg (data + globals) ----------------------------|                                          |
 * rng_coop ---------------------------------------|                                          |
 * sw ---------------------------------------------|                                          |
 * sh ---------------------------------------------|                                          |
 * queuesize --------------------------------------|                                          |
 *
 * Note on Queues :
 * Ideally we would want kernel_scene_intersect to work on queues.
 * But during the very first time, the queues will be empty and hence we perform a direct mapping
 * between ray-index and thread-index; From the next time onward, the queue will be filled and
 * we may start operating on queues.
 *
 * State of queue during the first time this kernel is called :
 * QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS and QUEUE_HITBG_BUFF_UPDATE_TOREGEN_RAYS will be empty.before and after this kernel
 *
 * State of queues during other times this kernel is called :
 * At entry,
 * QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS will have a mix of RAY_ACTIVE, RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER and RAY_REGENERATED rays;
 * QUEUE_HITBG_BUFF_UPDATE_TOREGEN_RAYS will be filled with RAY_TO_REGENERATE and RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER rays ;
 * (The rays that are in the state RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER in both the queues are actually the same rays; These
 * are the rays that were in RAY_ACTIVE state during the initial enqueue but on further processing
 * , by different kernels, have turned into RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER rays. Since all kernel, even after fetching from
 * QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS, proceed further based on ray state information, RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER rays
 * being present in QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS does not cause any logical issues)
 * At exit,
 * QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS - All RAY_REGENERATED rays will have been converted to RAY_ACTIVE and
 * Some rays in QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS queue will move to state RAY_HIT_BACKGROUND
 * QUEUE_HITBF_BUFF_UPDATE_TOREGEN_RAYS - no change
