#include "kernel_split_common.h"

/* Note on kernel_direct_lighting kernel.
 * This is the eighth kernel in the ray tracing logic. This is the seventh
 * of the path iteration kernels. This kernel takes care of direct lighting
 * logic. However, the "shadow ray cast" part of direct lighting is handled
 * in the next kernel.
 *
 * This kernels determines the rays for which a shadow_blocked() function associated with direct lighting should be executed.
 * Those rays for which a shadow_blocked() function for direct-lighting must be executed, are marked with flag RAY_SHADOW_RAY_CAST_DL and
 * enqueued into the queue QUEUE_SHADOW_RAY_CAST_DL_RAYS
 *
 * The input and output are as follows,
 *
 * rng_coop -----------------------------------------|--- kernel_direct_lighting --|--- BSDFEval_coop
 * PathState_coop -----------------------------------|                             |--- ISLamp_coop
 * sd -----------------------------------------------|                             |--- LightRay_coop
 * ray_state ----------------------------------------|                             |--- ray_state
 * Queue_data (QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS) ---|                             |
 * kg (globals) -------------------------------------|                             |
 * queuesize ----------------------------------------|                             |
 *
 * note on sd_DL : sd_DL is neither input nor output to this kernel; sd_DL is filled and consumed in this kernel itself.
 * Note on Queues :
 * This kernel only reads from the QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS queue and processes
 * only the rays of state RAY_ACTIVE; If a ray needs to execute the corresponding shadow_blocked
 * part, after direct lighting, the ray is marked with RAY_SHADOW_RAY_CAST_DL flag.
 *
 * State of queues when this kernel is called :
 * state of queues QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS and QUEUE_HITBG_BUFF_UPDATE_TOREGEN_RAYS will be same
 * before and after this kernel call.
 * QUEUE_SHADOW_RAY_CAST_DL_RAYS queue will be filled with rays for which a shadow_blocked function must be executed, after this
 * kernel call. Before this kernel call the QUEUE_SHADOW_RAY_CAST_DL_RAYS will be empty.
