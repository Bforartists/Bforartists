/*This kernel takes care of setting up ray for the next iteration of
 * path-iteration and accumulating radiance corresponding to AO and
 * direct-lighting
 *
 * Ray state of rays that are terminated in this kernel are changed
 * to RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER.
 *
 * Note on queues:
 * This kernel fetches rays from the queue QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS
 * and processes only the rays of state RAY_ACTIVE.
 * There are different points in this kernel where a ray may terminate and
 * reach RAY_UPDATE_BUFF state. These rays are enqueued into
 * QUEUE_HITBG_BUFF_UPDATE_TOREGEN_RAYS queue. These rays will still be present
 * in QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS queue, but since their ray-state has
 * been changed to RAY_UPDATE_BUFF, there is no problem.
 *
 * State of queues when this kernel is called:
 * At entry,
 *   - QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS will be filled with RAY_ACTIVE,
 *     RAY_REGENERATED, RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER rays.
 *   - QUEUE_HITBG_BUFF_UPDATE_TOREGEN_RAYS will be filled with
 *     RAY_TO_REGENERATE and RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER rays.
 * At exit,
 *   - QUEUE_ACTIVE_AND_REGENERATED_RAYS will be filled with RAY_ACTIVE,
 *     RAY_REGENERATED and more RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER rays.
 *   - QUEUE_HITBG_BUFF_UPDATE_TOREGEN_RAYS will be filled with
 *     RAY_TO_REGENERATE and more RAY_UPDATE_BUFFER rays.
