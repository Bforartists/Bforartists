/* Integrator State
 *
 * This file defines the data structures that define the state of a path. Any state that is
 * preserved and passed between kernel executions is part of this.
 *
 * The size of this state must be kept as small as possible, to reduce cache misses and keep memory
 * usage under control on GPUs that may execute millions of kernels.
 *
 * Memory may be allocated and passed along in different ways depending on the device. There may
 * be a scalar layout, or AoS or SoA layout for batches. The state may be passed along as a pointer
 * to every kernel, or the pointer may exist at program scope or in constant memory. To abstract
 * these differences between devices and experiment with different layouts, macros are used.
 *
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_ARGS: prepend to argument definitions for every function that accesses
 * path state.
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_CONST_ARGS: same as INTEGRATOR_STATE_ARGS, when state is read-only
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_PASS: use to pass along state to other functions access it.
 *
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE(x, y): read nested struct member x.y of IntegratorState
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_WRITE(x, y): write to nested struct member x.y of IntegratorState
 *
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_ARRAY(x, index, y): read x[index].y
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_ARRAY_WRITE(x, index, y): write x[index].y
 *
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_COPY(to_x, from_x): copy contents of one nested struct to another
 *
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_IS_NULL: test if any integrator state is available, for shader evaluation
 * INTEGRATOR_STATE_PASS_NULL: use to pass empty state to other functions.
 *
 * NOTE: if we end up with a device that passes no arguments, the leading comma will be a problem.
 * Can solve it with more macros if we encounter it, but rather ugly so postpone for now.
