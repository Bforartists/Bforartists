vector<float> blackbody_table_build()
{
	/* quoted from OSLs opcolor.cpp
	In order to speed up the blackbody computation, we have a table
	storing the precomputed BB values for a range of temperatures.  Less
	than BB_DRAPER always returns 0.  Greater than BB_MAX_TABLE_RANGE
	does the full computation, we think it'll be rare to inquire higher
	temperatures.

	Since the bb function is so nonlinear, we actually space the table
	entries nonlinearly, with the relationship between the table index i
	and the temperature T as follows:
	i = ((T-Draper)/spacing)^(1/xpower)
	T = pow(i, xpower) * spacing + Draper
	And furthermore, we store in the table the true value raised ^(1/5).
	I tuned this a bit, and with the current values we can have all
	blackbody results accurate to within 0.1% with a table size of 317
	(about 5 KB of data).
