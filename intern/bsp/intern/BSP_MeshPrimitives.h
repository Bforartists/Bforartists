/**
 * @section Mesh linkage
 * The mesh is linked in a similar way to the decimation mesh,
 * although the primitives are a little more general and not
 * limited to manifold meshes.
 * Vertices -> (2+)Edges
 * Edges -> (1+)Polygons
 * Edges -> (2)Vertices.
 * Polygons -> (3+)Vertices.
 *
 * this structure allows for arbitrary polygons (assumed to be convex).
 * Edges can point to more than 2 polygons (non-manifold)
 *
 * We also define 2 different link types between edges and their
 * neighbouring polygons. A weak link and a strong link.
 * A weak link means the polygon is in a different mesh fragment
 * to the other polygon. A strong link means the polygon is in the
 * same fragment.
 * This is not entirely consistent as it means edges have to be associated
 * with fragments, in reality only polygons will be - edges and vertices
 * will live in global pools. I guess we should mark edges as being on plane
 * boundaries. This leaves a problem with non-manifold edges because for example
 * 3 of 4 possible edges could lie in 1 fragment and the remaining edge lie in
 * another, there is no way to work out then from one polygon which neighbouring
 * polygons are in the same/different mesh fragment.
 *
 * By definition an edge will only ever lie on 1 hyperplane. We can then just
 * tag neighbouring polygons with one of 3 tags to group them.
