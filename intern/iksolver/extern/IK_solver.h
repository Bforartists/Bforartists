 * @mainpage IK - Blender inverse kinematics module.
 *
 * @section about About the IK module
 *
 * This module allows you to create segments and form them into 
 * chains. You can then define a goal point that the end of the 
 * chain should attempt to reach - an inverse kinematic problem.
 * This module will then modify the segments in the chain in
 * order to get the end of the chain as near as possible to the 
 * goal. This solver uses an inverse jacobian method to find
 * a solution.
 * 
 * @section issues Known issues with this IK solver.
 *
 * - The current solver works with only one type of segment. These
 * segments always have 3 degress of freedom (DOF). i.e. the solver
 * uses all these degrees to solve the IK problem. It would be 
 * nice to allow the user to specify different segment types such
 * as 1 DOF joints in a given plane. 2 DOF joints about given axis.
 * - There is currently no support for joint constraints in the
 * solver. This is within the realms of possibility - please ask
 * if this functionality is required.
 * - The solver is slow, inverse jacobian methods in general give
 * 'smooth' solutions and the method is also very flexible, it 
 * does not rely on specific angle parameterization and can be 
 * extended to deal with different joint types and joint 
 * constraints. However it is not suitable for real time use. 
 * Other algorithms exist which are more suitable for real-time
 * applications, please ask if this functionality is required.     
 * 
 * @section dependencies Dependencies
 * 
 * This module only depends on Moto.

/**
 * This structure defines a single segment of an IK chain. 
 * - Individual segments are always defined in local coordinates.
 * - The segment is assumed to be oriented in  the local 
 * y-direction.
 * - seg_start is the start of the segment relative to the end 
 * of the parent segment.
 * - basis is a column major matrix defining the rest position 
 * of the bone.
 * - length is the simply the length of the bone.  
 * - basis_change is a 3x3 matrix representing the change 
 * from the rest position of the segment to the solved position.
 * In fact it is the transpose of this matrix because blender 
 * does something weird with quaternion conversion. This is 
 * strictly an ouput variable for returning the results of an
 * an ik solve back to you.
 * The local transformation specified as a column major matrix 
 * of a segment is then defined as.
