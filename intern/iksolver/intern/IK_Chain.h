 * in an Inverse Kinematic solving routine. An IK solver operating
 * on the chain, will in general manipulate all the segments of the
 * chain in order to solve the IK problem.
 * 
 * To build a chain use the default constructor. Once built it's
 * then possible to add IK_Segments to the chain by inserting
 * them into the vector of IK_Segments. Note that segments will be
 * copied into the chain so chain's cannot share instances of 
 * IK_Segments. 
 * 
 * You have full control of which segments form the chain via the 
 * the std::vector routines.
