/**
 * MT_ExpMap an exponential map parameterization of rotations
 * in 3D. This implementation is derived from the paper 
 * "F. Sebastian Grassia. Practical parameterization of 
 * rotations using the exponential map. Journal of Graphics Tools,
 *  3(3):29-48, 1998" Please go to http://www.acm.org/jgt/papers/Grassia98/
 * for a thorough description of the theory and sample code used 
 * to derive this class. 
 *
 * Basic overview of why this class is used.
 * In an IK system we need to paramterize the joint angles in some
 * way. Typically 2 parameterizations are used.
 * - Euler Angles
 * These suffer from singularities in the parameterization known
 * as gimbal lock. They also do not interpolate well. For every
 * set of euler angles there is exactly 1 corresponding 3d rotation.
 * - Quaternions.
 * Great for interpolating. Only unit quaternions are valid rotations
 * means that in a differential ik solver we often stray outside of
 * this manifold into invalid rotations. Means we have to do a lot
 * of nasty normalizations all the time. Does not suffer from 
 * gimbal lock problems. More expensive to compute partial derivatives
 * as there are 4 of them.
 * 
 * So exponential map is similar to a quaternion axis/angle 
 * representation but we store the angle as the length of the
 * axis. So require only 3 parameters. Means that all exponential
 * maps are valid rotations. Suffers from gimbal lock. But it's
 * possible to detect when gimbal lock is near and reparameterize
 * away from it. Also nice for interpolating.
 * Exponential maps are share some of the useful properties of
 * euler and quaternion parameterizations. And are very useful
 * for differential IK solvers.
