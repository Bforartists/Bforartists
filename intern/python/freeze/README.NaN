This is a modification of the freeze.py script used to freeze python
modules as byte code in Blender.

To create this byte code, simply type 'make'. Freeze will then generate
the C source files in the TARGETDIR (specified in the Makefile), provided
that you have a valid python installation.

Be warned: testing of the module dependencies is needed, as these are
resolved AT RUNTIME!
