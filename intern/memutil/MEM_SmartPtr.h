/**
 * @section MEM_SmartPtr 
 * This class defines a smart pointer similar to that defined in 
 * the Standard Template Library but without the painful get()
 * semantics to access the internal c style pointer.
 *
 * It is often useful to explicitely decalre ownership of memory
 * allocated on the heap within class or function scope. This
 * class helps you to encapsulate this ownership within a value
 * type. When an instance of this class goes out of scope it
 * makes sure that any memory associated with it's internal pointer
 * is deleted. It can help to inform users of an aggregate class
 * that it owns instances of it's members and these instances 
 * should not be shared. This is not reliably enforcable in C++
 * but this class attempts to make the 1-1 relationship clear.
 * 
 * @section Example usage
 *
 * class foo {
 *		...constructors accessors etc.
 *		int x[1000];
 * }
 * 
 * class bar {
 *  public :
 *		static
 *			bar *
 *		New(
 *		) {
 *			MEM_SmartPtr<foo> afoo = new foo();
 *			MEM_SmartPtr<bar> that = new bar();
 *
 *			if (foo == NULL || that == NULL) return NULL;
 *
 *			that->m_foo = afoo.Release();
 *			return that.Release();
 *		}
 *
 *		~bar() {
 *			// smart ptr takes care of deletion
 *		}
 *	private :
 *		MEM_SmartPtr<foo> m_foo;
 *	}
 *			
 * You may also safely construct vectors of MEM_SmartPtrs and 
 * have the vector own stuff you put into it. 
 *
 * e.g.
 * { 
 * std::vector<MEM_SmartPtr<foo> > foo_vector;
 * foo_vector.push_back( new foo());
 * foo_vector.push_back( new foo());
 *
 * foo_vector[0]->bla();
 * } // foo_vector out of scope => heap memory freed for both foos
 *
 * @warning this class should only be used for objects created
 * on the heap via the new function. It will not behave correctly
 * if you pass ptrs to objects created with new[] nor with 
 * objects declared on the stack. Doing this is likely to crash
 * the program or lead to memory leaks.
