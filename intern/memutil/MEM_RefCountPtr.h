/**
 * @section MEM_RefCountable
 * This is a base class for reference countable objects.
 * If you want an object to be shared using a reference 
 * counted system derrivce from this class. All subclasses
 * should insist that they are created on the heap, this
 * can be done by makeing all constructors private and 
 * defining a static New() method that returns a ref counted
 * ptr to a new()ly allocated instance. 
 *
 * @section Example subclass
 *
 *
 * class MySharedObject : public MEM_RefCountable {
 *
 * private :
 *	MySharedObject() : MEM_RefCountable() { //class specific initialization};
 *  MySharedObject(const MySharedObject &other) // not implemented
 * public :
 *		static	
 *			MEM_RefCountPtr<MySharedObject> 
 *		New(
 *		) {
 *			return MEM_RefCountPtr<MySharedObject>( new MySharedObject());
 *		}
 *		
 *		// other member functions
 * };
 *
 * Alternitively you may first wish to define a fully functional
 * class and then define a reference counting wrapper for this class.
 * This is useful when the base type can be used without reference
 * counting.
 *
 * E.g.
 * class UsefullClass {
 * private :
 *  ...
 * public :
 *
 *      UsefullClass()
 *      UsefullMethod(...)
 *      AnotherUsefullMethod(...)
 * };
 *
 * class RcUsefullClass : public UsefullClass, public MEM_RefCountable
 * {
 * private :
 *      // Override base class public constructor --- forces
 *      // use of New(...)
 *      RcUsefullClass(...)
 * public :
 *
 *  // Override each public constructor of UsefullClass with
 *  // an equivalent static New method returning a MEM_RefCountPtr
 *
 *  static
 *      MEM_RefCountPtr<RcUsefullClass>
 *  New(...){
 *       return MEM_RefCountPtr<RcUsefullClass> output(
 *           new UsefullClass(...)
 *       );
 *   }
 *
 *  // warning never call destructor directly allow ref counting
 *  // mechanism to handle object lifetime.
 *  ~RcUsefullClass();
 * };
