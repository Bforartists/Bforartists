    GLog/GFlags: Reduce difference between upstream and bundled versions
    
    Several things here:
    
    - Re-bundled sources using own fork with pull-requests applied on the sources.
    
    - Got rid of changes around include "config.h", it was needed by Blender to
      make it's include directories configuration to work. This could be addressed
      differently from Blender side.
    
    - Moved some customization to defines set by CMakeLists.

    This was never ported to a new tracking pipeline and now it's done using
    FrameAccessor::Transform routines. Quite striaghtforward, but i've changed

    implement backward prediction
    
    The title actually says it all, just extend current implementation
    of PredictMarkerPosition() to cases when tracking happens in the reverse
    order (from the end frame to start).
    
    it's still doesn't solve all the ambiguity happening in the function
    in cases when one tracks the feature and then re-tracks it in order
    to refine the sliding. This is considered a separate TODO for now and
    will likely be solved by passing tracking direction to the prediction
    function.

    Fix search area sliding issue
    
    The only way to do this is to store search region in floats
    and round when we need to sample it. Otherwise you'll always
    have sliding effect caused by rounding the issues, especially
    when doing incremental offset (thing which happens in the
    prediction code).
    
    Pretty much straightforward change apart from stuff to be kept
    in mind: offset calculation int should happen relative to the
    rounded search region. This is because tracker works in the space
    of the search window image which get's rounded on the frame access,
    
    This makes API a bit creepy because frame accessor uses the same
    Region struct as the search window in Marker and ideally we would
    need to have either IntRegion or Region<int> in order to make
    Libmv fully track on what's getting rounded and when.

    Fix homography test failure
    
    It was caused by assuming that reconstructed homography matrix
    should look exactly the same as the matrix used to generate a
    test case.
    
    It's not actually valid assumption because different-looking
    matrices could correspond to the same exact transform.
    
    In this change we make it so actual "re-projected" vectors
    are being checked, not the values in matrix. This makes it
    more predictable verification.
