                First time reporting? See [tips](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/Bug_Reports).

                * Use **Help > Report a Bug** in Blender to fill system information and exact Blender version.
                * Test [daily builds](https://builder.blender.org/) to verify if the issue is already fixed.
                * Test [previous versions](https://download.blender.org/release/) to find an older working version.
                * For feature requests, feedback, questions or build issues, see [communication channels](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Communication/Contact#User_Feedback_and_Requests).
                * If there are multiple bugs, make multiple bug reports.
