        ### Instructions

        Guides to [contributing code](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/contributing/) and effective [code review](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/contributing/pull_requests/).

        By submitting code here, you agree that the code is (compatible with) GNU GPL v2 or later.

        By default, all contributors are added to the AUTHORS file as part of a semi-automated process.

        If you do not wish to be listed there and rather transfer copyright to the Blender Foundation please mention so at the bottom of the PR.
        This request only needs to be made once and applies to future PR's.
