This is a list of files (and needed files) for conformance testing of exporters
and importers The left hand column is the type of test and/or the folder the test is 
located in. The right hand column is the name of the blend file the test is in.  
If no blend file is listed then the test has not been created yet.
If you wish to contribute, please create a blend that is as simple as 
possible that can still test the functionality.  
Try to limit a blend to testing one thing unless it is a a 'complex test'.
