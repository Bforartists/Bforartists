At the fold where there is not yet a value, paint with the given brush 
(should have 0.250 Weight, 1.000 Strength, Add).

The shape should still look geometrically identical to the background one.

Sample the weight you altered, it should read 0.250
(See the lockTestStage1 image for where to paint and what it should look like)

Sample the weight of the same vertex on Bone.001, it should also read 0.250

Paint the spot again on Bone

It should still appear geometrically identical to the background object.

Resample:
Now Bone's weight at the fold should have gone up to 0.500
(See the lockTestStage2 image for where to paint and what it should look like)

Bone.001's weight for that vertex will be at 0.000

Any further attempts to add to Bone should not alter the weight
(0.500 will always be the sum of Bone's and Bone.001's weights at the fold)

You should not be able to paint the highest part of the object,
 and you should not be able to paint onto Bone.002
